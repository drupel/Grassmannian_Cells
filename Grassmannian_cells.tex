\title{Cell Decompositions for Rank Two Quiver Grassmannians}

\author{Dylan Rupel}
\author{Thorsten Weist}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
  We prove that all quiver Grassmannians for preprojective representations of a generalized Kronecker quiver admit a cell decomposition.  
  In the process, we introduce a class of regular representations which arise as quotients of consecutive preprojective representations.
  Cell decompositions for quiver Grassmannians of these ``truncated preprojectives'' are also established as well as for all indecomposable representations in their Auslander-Reiten components.
  We also provide a natural combinatorial labeling for these cells using compatible pairs in a maximal Dyck path.

\section{Introduction}
A cluster algebra is a subalgebra of a rational function field where generators are defined by an explicit recursion \cite{fomin-zelevinsky}.
Although the generators of the cluster algebra are given as rational functions they actually turn out to be Laurent polynomials.
These Laurent polynomial expressions for the cluster variables have been studied extensively and ultimately can be described using the representation theory of quivers \cite{caldero-chapoton,caldero-keller}: the cluster variables are generating functions for Euler characteristics of quiver Grassmannians.

For rank two cluster algebras, the Laurent expressions of cluster variables can also be computed using a certain Dyck path combinatorics \cite{lee-li-zelevinsky}.
The confluence of these results gives rise to a combinatorial construction for the Euler characteristics of certain quiver Grassmannians.
Our main result is a geometric explanation for this correspondence by constructing a decomposition of the quiver Grassmannians into affine cells which are labeled by compatible pairs.

\section{Terminology and Preliminary results}

Incorporate this into other sections...

\begin{lemma}
  Every preprojective and preinjective representation of $Q$ can be lifted to $\hat Q$ and $\tilde Q$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  This statement is clear for the simple representations $S_i$, $i\in Q_0$.
  Now every preprojective or preinjective representation of $Q$ can be obtained by applying a sequence of BGP-reflections \cite{bgp} to a simple representation $S'_j$ of a quiver $Q'$ whose underlying graph is the same as the one for $Q$.
  Applying a BGP-reflection to a vertex $i$ of $Q$ corresponds to applying BGP-reflections to all vertices $(i,\chi)$ of $\hat Q$ (resp. $(i,w)$ of $\tilde Q$).
  This gives the claim.
\end{proof}
As $F_Q$ and $G_Q$ are covering functors when restricting to one connected component, we obtain
\begin{theorem}
  \label{covering}
  The functors $F_Q$ and $G_Q$ preserve indecomposability.
  Moreover, for all representations $\hat X,\hat Y \in\Rep(\hat Q)$, we have 
  \[\Hom_Q(F_Q\hat X, F_Q\hat Y)\cong \bigoplus_{\chi\in A_Q}\Hom_{\tilde Q}(\hat X_\chi,\hat Y)\cong\bigoplus_{\chi\in A_Q}\Hom_{\tilde Q}(\hat X,\hat Y_\chi).\]
  The analogous statements are true when replacing $\Hom$ by $\Ext$ or $\Rep(\hat Q)$ by $\Rep(\tilde Q)$.
\end{theorem}

Recall that every tuple of linear maps $(g_\alpha:X_{s(\alpha)}\to Y_{t(\alpha)})_{\alpha\in Q_1}$ defines a short exact sequence $\ses{Y}{Z}{X}$ with middle term defined by the vector spaces $Z_i=X_i\oplus Y_i$ for all $i\in Q_0$ and linear maps $Z_\alpha=\begin{pmatrix}Y_\alpha &g_\alpha\\0&X_\alpha\end{pmatrix}$ for all $\alpha\in Q_1$. 
In general, considering the linear map  
\[d_{X,Y}:\bigoplus_{i\in Q_0}\Hom_k(X_i,Y_i)\to\bigoplus_{\alpha\in Q_1}\Hom_k(X_{s(\alpha)},Y_{t(\alpha)}), (f_i)_{i\in Q_0}\mapsto(f_{t(\alpha)}\circ X_\alpha-Y_\alpha\circ f_{s(\alpha)})_{\alpha\in Q_1} \]
we have $\mathrm{ker}(d_{X,Y})=\Hom_Q(X,Y)$ and $\mathrm{coker}(d_{X,Y})=\Ext_Q(X,Y)$.

\section{Torus Actions on Quiver Grassmannians}
\label{torusaction}

Move this somewhere...

For an introduction to covering theory we refer to \cite{gab}. Let $Q$ be an acyclic quiver with vertices $Q_0$ and arrows $Q_1$ which we denote by $\alpha:i\to j$. We denote by $\Rep(Q)$ the category of $\C$-representations of $Q$. Moreover, let $A_Q\cong \ZZ^{Q_1}$ be the free abelian group and $W_{Q}$ be the free non-abelian group generated by $Q_1$.  
\begin{definition}
The universal abelian covering quiver $\hat Q$ of $Q$ is given by the vertices $\hat Q_0=Q_0\times A_{Q}$ and the arrow set $\hat Q_1=Q_1\times A_{Q}$ where $(\alpha,\chi):(i,\chi)\to (j,\chi+e_\alpha)$ for every $\alpha:i\to j$.

The universal covering quiver $\tilde Q$ of $Q$ is given by the vertices $\tilde Q_0=Q_0\times W_{Q}$ and the arrow set $\tilde Q_1=Q_1\times W_{Q}$ where $(\alpha,w):(i,w)\to (j,w\alpha)$ for every $\alpha:i\to j$.

We say that a representation $X\in \Rep(Q)$ can be lifted to $\hat Q$ (resp. $\tilde Q$) if there exists a representation $\hat X\in\Rep(\hat Q)$ (resp. $\tilde X\in\Rep(\tilde Q)$) such that $F_Q\hat X=X$ (resp. $G_Q \tilde X=X$) where $F_Q:\Rep(\hat Q)\to\Rep(Q)$ (resp. $G_Q:\Rep(\tilde Q)\to\Rep(Q)$) is the natural functor.
\end{definition}
Note that in our definition every covering quiver has infinitely many connected components. But every connected component is a covering in the sense of \cite{gab}. As indecomposable representations live on one component this makes no difference.
Note that we also have a natural functor $H_Q:\Rep(\tilde Q)\to \Rep(\hat Q)$.
Moreover, note that every connected component of the universal covering quiver of the universal abelian covering quiver is isomorphic to a connected component of the universal covering quiver of the original quiver. The functor $F_Q$ induces a map $F_Q:\ZZ^{\hat Q_1}\to \ZZ^{Q_1}$. We say that a dimension vector $\hat \bfe$ of $\hat Q$ is compatible with $\bfe$ if $F_Q(\hat\bfe)=\bfe$. The group $A_Q$ acts on $\hat Q$ via translation inducing an action on $\Rep(\hat Q)$ and on $\ZZ^{\hat Q_1}$. We say two representation (resp. dimension vectors) are equivalent in this case. The analogous observation can also be made for $\tilde Q$. If $M$ is a representation of $\hat Q$ (resp. $\tilde Q$), we denote the representation obtained by translation by $\chi\in A_Q$ (resp. $w\in W_Q$) by $M_\chi$ (resp. $M_w$).  

\subsection{Bialynicki-Birula decomposition}
The aim of Section \ref{torusaction} is to define a torus action on quiver Grassmannians which can be used to simplify the calculation of homological invariants in general. If the quiver Grassmannian is smooth, which is for instance the case for exceptional representations by \cite{cr}, it can also be used to stratify the quiver Grassmannians using the results of Bialynicki-Birula. More detailed, let $X$ be a smooth projective variety with a $\C^\ast$-action. For a connecting component of the fixed point set $C\subset X^{\C^\ast}$, we define its attracting set as
\[\mathrm{Att}(C):=\{y\in X\mid \lim_{t\to 0}t.y\in C\}\]

Then we have the following statement, \cite[Section 4]{bb}:
\begin{theorem}Let $\coprod_{i=1}^r C_i= X^{\C^\ast}$ be the decomposition into connected components. Then $\mathrm{Att}(C_i)$ is a locally closed smooth $\C^\ast$-invariant subvariety of $X$ where $C_i$ is a subvariety of $\mathrm{Att}(C_i)$. Moreover, we have $X=\coprod_{i=1}^r\mathrm{Att}(C_i)$ and
the natural map $\gamma_i:\mathrm{Att}(C_i)\to C_i$ is an affine vector bundle. 

In particular, we have $\chi(X)=\chi(X^{\C^\ast})$ for the Euler characteristic.
\end{theorem}

Move this???

Let $\ses{M}{B}{N}$ be a short exact sequence of representations. This induces a map between quiver Grassmannians
\[\Psi_\tbfe:Gr_\tbfe(B)\to\bigsqcup_{\tbff+\tbfg=\tbfe}  Gr_\tbff(M)\times Gr_\tbfg(N),\,U\mapsto (U\cap M,(U+M)/M)\]
which is also called Caldero-Chapoton map.  By the results of \cite[Section 3]{cc} it follows that $\Psi^{-1}_\tbfe(A,V)=\mathbb{A}^{\dim\Hom(A,M/V)}$ for all pairs of subrepresentations $(A,V)$ for which the fibre is not empty.
Let $\cG_{\tbff,\tbfg}:=\Psi^{-1}_\tbfe(\Gr_\tbff(M)\times \Gr_\tbfg(N))$. Then we have
$$\Gr_\tbfe(B)=\bigsqcup_{\tbff+\tbfg=\tbfe} \cG_{\tbff,\tbfg}.$$
The map $\Psi_\tbfe$ restricts to morphisms of projective varieties
\[\Psi_\tbfe^{\tbff,\tbfg}:\cG_{\tbff,\tbfg}\to \Gr_\tbff(M)\times \Gr_\tbfg(N).\]

The following is proved in \cite[Section 3]{cefr}.
\begin{theorem}\label{vb}
If the fibre dimension of $\Psi_\tbfe^{\tbff,\tbfg}$ is constant over $\mathrm{Im}(\Psi_\tbfe^{\tbff,\tbfg})$, then it an affine bundle over the image. In particular, the existence of a cell decomposition of $\mathrm{Im}(\Psi_\tbfe^{\tbff,\tbfg})$ implies a cell decomposition of $\cG_{\tbff,\tbfg}$ in this case.
\end{theorem}
%\begin{proof}\footnote{sketch, double-check}


%As $X$ and $Y$ are projective, they are compact. As the fibres are affine spaces of constant dimension and as $X$ and $Y$ are smooth, the induced morphism on the tangent spaces is surjective for all points $x\in X$. This shows that $f$ is smooth of relative dimension $n$, see Hartshorne and thus a submersion?!



%\end{proof}


%%%


\noindent 
Fix a vector space $X$ of dimension $n$ and let $d\leq n$. We first consider a natural torus action on usual Grassmannians coming along with any direct sum decomposition of the vector space $X$. Then we generalize the concept to quiver Grassmannians, but we will see that the torus fixed point set can be calculated in an analogous manner. Thus assume that $X=\bigoplus_{j=1}^l X_j$ is a direct sum decomposition of $X$. We choose a basis $\mathcal B=\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ of $X$ which is compatible with this decomposition, i.e. there exist numbers $1\leq j_1\leq j_2\ldots\leq j_{l-1}\leq n$ such that
\[v_1,\ldots,v_{j_1}\in X_1,\,v_{j_1+1},\ldots,v_{j_2}\in X_2,\ldots,v_{j_{l-1}+1},\ldots,v_{n}\in X_l\]
Moreover, we choose a map $d:\{1,\ldots,n\}\to\mathbb{Z}$ such that $d(i)=d(i')$ if $v_i,v_{i'}\in X_{j}$ for some $j$. Then there exists a $\C^\ast$-action on $X$ when extending the definition $t.v_i:=t^{d(j)}v_i$ if $v_i\in X_j$ linearly to $X$. This naturally induces an action of $\C^\ast$ on the usual Grassmannians $\Gr_d(X)$. We can write every $U\in\Gr_d(X)$ uniquely in row-echelon form with respect to the basis $\mathcal B$, i.e. there exists a unique sequence $1\leq i_1\leq\ldots\leq i_d\leq n$ and a unique matrix representation of $U$ of the form
\[M(U):=\begin{pmatrix}\ast&\ldots &\ast &1&0 &\ldots&\ldots&\ldots&\ldots&\ldots&\ldots&\ldots&\ldots&\ldots&0\\\ast&\ldots &\ast&0&\ast&\ldots &\ast&1&0&\ldots&\ldots&\ldots&\ldots&\ldots&0\\\vdots &\ddots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots &\ddots&\vdots&0&\ast&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots&\vdots\\\vdots &\ddots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots &\ddots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots&\vdots\\\ast&\ldots &\ast&0&\ast&\ldots &\ast&0&\ast&\ldots&\ast&1&0&\ldots&0\end{pmatrix}\in M_{d,n}(k)\]
where the unit vectors are in the columns $i_1,\ldots,i_d$. All matrix representations of this form define a Schubert cell $X_{\bfi}$ where $\bfi=(i_1,\ldots,i_d)$. The $\C^\ast$-action is then given by multiplying the $w^{\mathrm{th}}$ column with $t^{d(w)}$, i.e. we have
\[(t.M(U))_{u,w}=t^{d(w)}\cdot M(U)_{u,w}.\]
Every Schubert cell is invariant under the torus action, i.e. $t.M(U)\in X_\bfi$ for all $M(U)\in X_{\bfi}$. 
\begin{lemma}\label{usualGrass}
Choose $d$ in such a way that $d(i)\neq d(i')$ if $v_i\in X_j$, $v_{i'}\in X_{j'}$ and $j\neq j'$.
Then we have $U\in X_{\bfi}^{\C^\ast}$ if and only if $U=\bigoplus_{i=1}^l U\cap X_i$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}If $U=\bigoplus_{i=1}^l U\cap X_i$, we have 
\[t.U=\bigoplus_{i=1}^l t.(U\cap X_i)=\bigoplus_{i=1}^l t^{d(j_i+1)}(U\cap X_i)=U\]
where $j_0=0$.

Assume that $U$ is a torus fixed with $M(U)\in X_{\bfi}$. Fix the $w^{\mathrm{th}}$ column $M(U)_w$ and assume that $v_{i_w}\in X_s$. As the matrix representation $M(U)$ is uniquely determined, by the assumption on $d$, it follows that all matrix coefficients corresponding to a basis element $v_i$ such that $v_i\notin X_s$ are zero. This means that $\widehat{M(U)}_w\in X_s$ where $\widehat{M(U)}_w$ is the vector of $U$ corresponding to $M(U)_w$. As the colums are linear independent, this already shows the claim.
\end{proof}
The next step is to generalize this to quiver Grassmannians.

Let $Q$ be an acyclic quiver. We choose a map $d:\hat Q_0\to\ZZ$ and fix a representation $X\in\Rep(Q)$ which can be lifted to $\hat Q$. We can consider the decomposition $X_q=\bigoplus_{(q,\chi)\in A_Q} X_{(q,\chi)}$. We define a torus action on each $X_{(q,\chi)}$ via $t.x_{(q,\chi)}=t^{d(q,\chi)}x_{(q,\chi)}$ which can be extended linearly to each $X_q$. For a fixed a subspace $U_q$, we can define the subspace $t.U_q$. In general, this torus action induces no torus action on the Quiver Grassmannians $\Gr_{\bfe}(X)$ as $t.U=(t.U_q)_{q\in Q_0}$ is no subrepresentation of $X$ for every $U\in \Gr_{\bfe}(X)$. Actually, such an action has to satisfy $X_{\alpha}(t.U_i)\in t.U_j$ for every $\alpha:i\to j$. 
\begin{lemma}Fix an integer $c_\alpha\in\ZZ$ for every $\alpha\in Q_1$.
If $X\in\Rep(Q)$ can be lifted, $d:\hat Q_0\to\ZZ$ induces a torus action on $\Gr_\bfe(X)$ if we have $d(j,\chi+e_\alpha)-d(i,\chi)=c_\alpha$ for all $\alpha:i\to j$ and $\chi\in A_{Q}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} Let $U\in \Gr_\bfe(X)$. Since $X$ can be lifted, we can write $X_\alpha:X_i\to X_j$ as block matrix consisting of linear maps $X_{(\alpha,\chi)}:X_{(i,\chi)}\to X_{(j,\chi+e_\alpha)}$. Let $u_{(i,\chi)}\in U_{(i,\chi)}$ and $\alpha:i\to j\in Q_1$. Then we have $X_\alpha(u_{(i,\chi)})\in U_{(j,\chi+e_\alpha)}$ because $X$ can be lifted to the universal cover. Then it follows
\[X_\alpha(t.u_{(i,\chi)})=X_\alpha(t^{d(i,\chi)}u_{(i,\chi)})=t^{d(i,\chi)}X_\alpha(u_{(i,\chi)})=t^{d(i,\chi)}u_{(j,\chi+e_\alpha)}=t^{-c_\alpha}t.u_{(j,\chi+e_\alpha)}\]
for some $u_{(j,\chi+e_\alpha)}\in U_{(j,\chi+e_\alpha)}$.
Now we have \[\bigoplus_{\chi\in A_Q} t.U_{(j,\chi)}=\bigoplus_{\chi\in A_Q}t^{c(j,\chi)}t.U_{(j,\chi)}\]
for every $t\in\C^\ast$ if $c(j,\chi)$ is constant along $(j,\chi)\in \{j\}\times A_Q$. This yields  
\[t.U_j=\bigoplus_{\chi\in A_Q} t.U_{(j,\chi)}=\bigoplus_{\chi\in A_Q}t^{-c_\alpha}t.U_{(j,\chi)}\]
for every $t\in \C^\ast$.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}\label{degreecondition} Let $X$ be an indecomposable representation of $\hat Q$. There exists $d:\mathrm{supp} (X)\to\ZZ$ and $c_\alpha\in\mathbb N_+$ for each $\alpha\in Q_1$ such that $d(i,\chi)\ne d(j,\chi')$ if $i\neq j$ or $\chi\neq \chi'$ and such that $d(j,\chi')-d(i,\chi)=c_\alpha$ if and only if $\chi'=\chi+e_\alpha$ and $(i,\chi),\,(j,\chi+e_\alpha)\in \mathrm{supp}(X)$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since $X$ is finite-dimensional, $\mathrm{supp}( X)$ is a connected finite tree. In order to prove the statement, we may assume that $d(q,0)=0$ and that $(q,0)\in \mathrm{supp}(X)$. We now fix numbers $c_\alpha$ and show that the two conditions are satisfied. To do so, let $K$ be the maximal length of a path in $\mathrm{supp}(X)$ and assume that $|Q_1|=n$. Set $c_{\alpha_1}=1$ and inductively 
\[c_{\alpha_n}> (K+1)\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}c_{\alpha_i}.\]
Note that if $A_Q$ is the free abelian group in the generators $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n$ and $f:A_Q\to \ZZ$ the group homomorphism defined by $f(\alpha)=c_\alpha$ for all $\alpha\in Q_1$,  we have $d(q,\chi)=f(\chi)$. In particular, there exist $d_i$ with $|d_i|\leq K$ such that we have
\[d(q,\chi)=\sum_{i=1}^nd_ic_{\alpha_i}.\]

First note that we obviously have $d(j,\chi+\alpha)-d(i,\chi)=c_\alpha$. Now assume that $d(i,\chi)=d(j,\chi')$ which means that $d(i,\chi)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}d_ic_{\alpha_i}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_ic_{\alpha_i}=d(j,\chi')$
which implies
\[\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(d_i-e_i)c_{\alpha_i}=(e_{n}-d_{n})c_{\alpha_{n}}.\]
Since we have $|d_i-e_i|\leq K$, we obtain $$|\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(d_i-e_i)c_{\alpha_i}|\leq K\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}c_{\alpha_i}<c_{\alpha_n}$$
This inductively yields $d_i=e_i$ for $i=n,\ldots,1$ by the choice of $c_{\alpha_{i}}$. An analogous proof applies to show that $d(j,\chi')-d(i,\chi)\neq c_\alpha$ if $\chi'\neq \chi+e_\alpha$ using that, actually, $c_{\alpha_n}> (K+1)\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}c_{\alpha_i}$. 

\end{proof}
In the following, we say that $d:\mathrm{supp}(X)\to\ZZ$ satisfies the degree condition for $X$ if it has the properties of Lemma \ref{degreecondition}.



\begin{theorem}Let $X$ be a representation which can be lifted to $\hat Q$ and choose $d:\mathrm{supp}(X)\to \ZZ$ such that it satisfies the degree condition for $X$. Then the torus action of $T$ on $\bigoplus_{q\in Q_0}X_q$ induced by $t.x_{(q,\chi)}=t^{d(q,\chi)}x_{(q,\chi)}$ for $x_{(q,\chi)}\in X_{(q,\chi)}$ induces
 a torus action on $Gr_\bfe^Q(X)$ such that
  $$Gr^Q_\bfe(X)^T\cong\bigsqcup_{\hat\bfe} Gr^{\hat Q}_{\hat\bfe}(\hat X)$$ where $\hat\bfe$ runs through all dimension vectors compatible with $\bfe$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
A representation $U\in\Gr_{\bfe}(X)$ is a torus fixed point if and only if $t.U=U $ for all $t\in\C^\ast$, i.e. $t.U_q=U_q$ for all $q\in Q_0$, $t\in\C^\ast$. Thus, apart from being a subrepresentation of $X$, it is a fixed point of the torus actions on the usual Grassmannians $\Gr_{\bfe_q}(X_q)$ induced by the decompositions $X_q=\bigoplus_{\chi\in A_Q} X_{q,\chi}$. A subrepresentation $U\subset X$ can be lifted to the universal abelian covering if and only if
\[X_q\cap U_q=\bigoplus_{\chi\in A_Q} X_{(q,\chi)}\cap U_{(q,\chi)}=\bigoplus_{\chi\in A_Q}U_{(q,\chi)}.\]
Thus we can apply Lemma \ref{usualGrass} to obtain the claim.
\end{proof}
The next step is to iterate the torus action keeping in mind the following idea: every representation, which lifts to the universal covering quiver, also lifts to the universal abelian covering quiver and also to the iterated universal abelian covering quivers, i.e. to $\hat Q^{(k)}:=\widehat{\hat Q^{(k-1)}}$ with $\hat Q=\hat Q^{(1)}$. Now it is straightforward to check that there exist natural surjective morphisms $f_k:\tilde Q\to \hat Q^{(k)}$ which become injective on finite subquivers if $k\gg 0$, see also \cite[Section 3.4]{wei}. Since the support of $X$ is finite as a representation of $\tilde Q$, we can find $k\geq 1$ such that the full subquiver with vertices $\mathrm{supp}(X)\subseteq \hat Q^{(k)}_0$ is a tree. Thus, if $\hat X^{(k)}$ is the lift of $X$ to $\hat Q^{(k)}$, there exists a torus action on the vector spaces $\hat X^{(k)}_q$ which induce a torus action on the quiver Grassmannian $Gr_{\bfe}^{\hat Q^{(k)}}(\hat X^{(k)})$. If we denote the iterated torus fixed points by $Gr^Q_\bfe(X)^{T^{(k)}}$. We obtain:
\begin{corollary}
Let $X$ be a representation which can be lifted to $\tilde Q$. Then there exists an iterated torus action such that
  $$Gr^Q_\bfe(X)^{T^{(k)}}\cong \bigsqcup_{\hat\bfe^{(k-1)}} Gr_{\hat\bfe^{(k-1)}}^{\hat Q^{(k-1)}}(\hat X^{(k-1)})^T\cong \bigsqcup_{\hat\bfe^{(k)}} Gr^{\hat Q}_{\hat\bfe^{(k)}}(\hat X^{(k)})\cong \bigsqcup_{\tilde\bfe} Gr^{\tilde Q}_{\tilde\bfe}(\tilde X)$$ where $\hat\bfe^{(k-1)},\,\hat\bfe^{(k)},\,\tilde\bfe$ run through all dimension vectors compatible with $\bfe$.
\end{corollary}
%\begin{corollary}
%  affine bundles over $Gr^{\tilde Q}_{\tilde\bfe}(\tilde X)$ if $Gr^Q_\bfe(X)$ is smooth
%  \[\{U\in Gr^Q_\bfe(X):\lim_{t\to0} t\cdot U\in Gr^{\tilde Q}_{\tilde\bfe}(\tilde X)\}\]
%\end{corollary}
Define the $F$-polynomial of a representation $X$ by 
$$F_X=\sum_{\bfe\in\NN^{Q_0}}\chi(\Gr_\bfe(X))x^e\in\ZZ[x_q\mid q\in Q_0].$$

\begin{corollary}\label{fpoly}
Let $X$ be a representation which can be lifted to the universal covering quiver.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
If  $\Gr_\bfe(X)$ is smooth and $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_{\tilde \tbfe}(\tilde X)$ has a cell decomposition into affine spaces, then $\Gr_\bfe(X)$ has a cell decomposition into affine spaces.
\item We have $F_X=SF_{\tilde X}$ where $SF_{\tilde X}$ is obtained from $F_{\tilde X}$ by applying $S:\ZZ[x_{(q,w)}\mid q\in Q_0,w\in W_Q]\to\ZZ[x_q\mid q\in Q_0]$ given by $S(x_{(q,w)})=x_q$ for all $q\in Q_0$ and $w\in W_Q$.
\end{enumerate} 
\end{corollary}
An important special case for this is the case of exceptional representations. In this case the quiver Grassmannians $\Gr_\tbfe(X)$ are smooth by \cite[Corollary 4]{cr}. Moreover, every exceptional representation is a tree module by \cite{rin1} which means that it can be lifted to the universal covering.

\section{Representation Theory of $K(n)$}

\noindent Denote by $K(n)$ the \emph{$n$-Kronecker quiver} $1\stackrel{n}{\longleftarrow}2$ with vertices $K_0(n)=\{1,2\}$ and $n$ arrows from vertex $2$ to vertex $1$. 
The category $\rep K(n)$ of finite-dimensional representations of $K(n)$ is equivalent to the category of modules over the path algebra $A(n)$ of $K(n)$.
As a $\CC$-vector space, the path algebra $A(n)$ can be written as $A_0\oplus A_1$, where 
\begin{itemize}
  \item $A_0=\CC e_1\oplus \CC e_2$ is a two-dimensional semisimple algebra with orthogonal idempotents $e_1$ and $e_2$;
  \item $A_1=\bigoplus_{i=1}^n \CC a_i$ is the $A_0$-bimodule spanned by the arrows of $K(n)$, that is $e_ka_ie_\ell=\delta_{k1}\delta_{\ell2}a_i$ for $1\le i\le n$ and $k,\ell\in\{1,2\}$.
\end{itemize}
Observe that $GL_n(\CC)$ naturally acts on $A_1$ and hence $GL_n(\CC)$ acts on $\rep K(n)$ via the induced action on $A(n)$.
More precisely, given a representation $M=(M_1,M_2,M_{a_i})$ of $K(n)$ and $g=(g_{ij})\in GL_n(\CC)$, the representation $g.M$ is given by $(M_1,M_2,M'_{a_i})$ with $M'_{a_i}=\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}M_{a_j}$.
Note that $M$ and $g.M$ are not necessarily isomorphic as representations of $K(n)$.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:hom equivariance}
  For any morphism $\theta:M\to N$ between representations $M,N\in\rep K(n)$, the same maps $\theta_1:M_1\to N_1$ and $\theta_2:M_2\to N_2$ give a morphism $\theta^g:g.M\to g.N$ for any $g\in GL_n(\CC)$.
  In particular, the hom-spaces $\Hom(M,N)$ and $\Hom(g.M,g.N)$ are canonically identified for each $g\in G$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $\theta:M\to N$ is a morphism of representations, i.e.\ $\theta_2\circ M_{a_j}=N_{a_j}\circ\theta_1$ for $1\le j\le n$.
  Then for $g=(g_{ij})\in GL_n(\CC)$, we have
  \[\theta_2\circ M'_{a_i}=\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}(\theta_2\circ M_{a_j})=\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}(M_{a_j}\circ\theta_1)=N'_{a_i}\circ\theta_1\]
  for $1\le i\le n$ so that $\theta$ also gives a morphism from $g.M$ to $g.N$. 
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:indecomposability}
  For $M\in\rep K(n)$ and $g\in GL_n(\CC)$, the representation $M$ is indecomposable if and only if $g.M$ is indecomposable.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  The representation $M$ is decomposable if there exists a split epimorphism $\theta:M\onto N$ for some nonzero representation $N$.
  But this occurs exactly when the map $\theta^g:g.M\onto g.N$ is also a split epimorphism.
\end{proof}

Write $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ for the BGP-reflection functors of $K(n)$ \cite{bgp}. 
Note that (up to relabeling vertices) the quiver $K(n)$ itself does not change when applying the reflection functors and thus we view these as endofunctors acting on the category $\rep K(n)$. 
With this identification of $K(n)$ and $K(n)^{op}$, the endofunctors $\Sigma_2\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_1\Sigma_2$ are each naturally isomorphic to the identity maps on the full subcategories $\rep_{\langle 1\rangle} K(n),\rep_{\langle 2\rangle} K(n)\subset \rep K(n)$, where the objects of $\rep_{\langle i\rangle} K(n)$ are those representations of $K(n)$ which do not contain the simple $S_i$ as a direct summand.
Also, following \cite{brenner-butler}, the Auslander-Reiten translation $\tau:\rep K(n)\to\rep K(n)$ may be identified with the functor $\Sigma_1^2$.

While the reflection functors are not $GL_n(\CC)$-equivariant, they do admit the following twisted equivariance.
\begin{lemma}\label{compatibleGSigma}
  For $g\in G$, the reflection functors $\Sigma_i:\rep K(n)\to\rep K(n)$ satisfy $g.\Sigma_i(M)=\Sigma_i(g^{-T}.M)$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We present all the details for $\Sigma_2$, the proof for $\Sigma_1$ is similar.
  For $M\in\rep K(n)$, we have $\Sigma_2(M)=(M_1,M'_2,M'_{a_i})$, where $M'_2$ fits into the following exact sequence:
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & M_2 \ar[r]^{\bigoplus\limits_{i=1}^n M_{a_i}} & \bigoplus\limits_{i=1}^n M_1 \ar[r]^\pi & M'_2 \ar[r] & 0}\]
  and $M'_{a_i}=\pi\circ\iota_i$ for $\iota_i:M_1\to\bigoplus_{i=1}^n M_1$ the inclusion of the $i$-th factor.
  Then for $g=(g_{ij})\in GL_n(\CC)$, we have $g.\Sigma_2(M)=(M_1,M'_2,M''_{a_i})$ with 
  \[M''_{a_i}=\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}M'_{a_j}=\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}(\pi\circ\iota_j)=\pi\circ\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}\iota_j=\pi\circ g^T\circ\iota_i.\]
  In particular, we may construct $g.\Sigma_2(M)$ using the following exact sequence:
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & M_2 \ar[r]^{g^{-T}\circ\bigoplus\limits_{i=1}^n M_{a_i}} & \bigoplus\limits_{i=1}^n M_1 \ar[r]^{\pi\circ g^T} & M'_2 \ar[r] & 0},\]
  i.e. $g.\Sigma_2(M)=\Sigma_2(g^{-T}.M)$.
\end{proof}

Define Chebyshev polynomials $u_k$ for $k\in\ZZ$ by the recursion $u_0=0$, $u_1=1$, $u_{k+1}=nu_k-u_{k-1}$.
The following is well-known.
\begin{theorem}
  \label{th:rigids}
  For each $m\ge1$, there exist unique (up to isomorphism) indecomposable rigid representations $P_m$ and $I_m$ of $K(n)$ with dimension vectors $(u_m,u_{m-1})$ and $(u_{m-1},u_m)$ respectively. 
  Moreover, any rigid representation of $K(n)$ is isomorphic to one of the form $P_m^{a_1}\oplus P_{m+1}^{a_2}$ or $I_m^{a_1}\oplus I_{m+1}^{a_2}$ for some $m\ge1$ and some $a_1,a_2\ge0$.
\end{theorem}
The representations $P_m$ are called the \emph{preprojective} representations of $K(n)$ and the representations $I_m$ are called \emph{preinjective}.
\begin{remark}\footnote{we should have $P_m=(\Sigma_iP_{m-1})^T$}
  \label{rem:reflection recursion}
  These representations satisfy the following recursions using the reflection functors:
  \[P_1=S_1,\quad P_m=\Sigma_2 P_{m-1},\quad I_1=S_2,\quad I_m=\Sigma_1 I_{m-1}\]
  for $m\ge2$.
  In particular, we have $P_{m-1}=\tau P_{m+1}$ and $I_{m+1}=\tau I_{m-1}$ for $m\ge2$. 
\end{remark}
%\begin{corollary}
%  \label{cor:preprojective stability}
%  For $m\ge1$ and $g\in G$, the representations $P_m$ and $g.P_m$ are isomorphic.
%\end{corollary}
%\begin{proof}
%  By construction, the representation $g.P_m$ also has dimension vector $(u_m,u_{m-1})$ and is indecomposable by Corollary~\ref{cor:indecomposability}.
%  Thus by Theorem~\ref{th:rigids}, $P_m$ and $g.P_m$ are isomorphic.
%\end{proof}
%For $g\in GL_n(\CC)$, write $\phi_{m,g}:P_m\to g.P_m$ for the (unique up to scalars) isomorphism from Corollary~\ref{cor:preprojective stability}.

Set $H_m:=\Hom(P_m,P_{m+1})$ for $m\ge1$. %and define an action of $GL_n(\CC)$ on $H_m$ by $g.\theta:=\phi_{m+1,g}^{-1}\circ\theta^g\circ\phi_{m,g}$.
%Note that the first $\theta$ here represents an element of $H_m$ while the second $\theta^g$ represents the corresponding element of $H_m^g:=\Hom(g.P_m,g.P_{m+1})$ from Lemma~\ref{le:hom equivariance}.
Write $Gr(H_m)$ for the \emph{total Grassmannian} of $H_m$ whose elements are nontrivial proper subspaces $V\subset H_m$.
Some results below remain true if we allow $H_m$ or $0$ as elements of $Gr(H_m)$, but not all, so for uniformity of exposition we omit these possibilities.
%Lemma~\ref{le:hom equivariance} gives an identification of $Gr(H_m)$ with $Gr(H_m^g)$ and we write $V\mapsto V^g$ for this correspondence.
For $1\le d\le n-1$, let $Gr_d(H_m)\subset Gr(H_m)$ be the subvariety of $d$-dimensional subspaces of $H_m$.
%\begin{lemma}
%  \label{le:transitivity}
%  The action of $GL_n(\CC)$ on $H_m$ induces a transitive action of $GL_n(\CC)$ on each component $Gr_d(H_m)$.
%\end{lemma} 
%\begin{proof}
%  The map $\theta\mapsto g.\theta$ for $\theta\in H_m$ induces a group homomorphism $GL_n(\CC)\to GL(H_m)$ which we denote by $g\mapsto\tilde g_m$.
%  We claim that this homomorphism is surjective which immediately implies the result.
%
%  We work by induction on $m$.
%  Suppose $GL_n(\CC)\to GL(H_m)$ is surjective.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:injective evaluation maps}
  For any $V\in Gr(H_m)$, the natural evaluation map $ev_V:P_m\otimes V\to P_{m+1}$ is injective.
\end{lemma}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% needs polishing %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{proof}
  \footnote{This needs to be cleaned up, the proof seems false as written.}
  A nonzero element $f\in V$ corresponds to an irreducible morphism $f:P_m\to P_{m+1}$ and thus does not factor through any representation $Z\ne P_m$, in particular $f$ is injective.
  But any nonzero element of $\ker ev_V$ gives rise to a nonzero $f\in V$ which is not injective and thus $ev_V$ must be an injective map.
\end{proof}

In what follows we will not distinguish between $P_m\otimes V$ and its image under $ev_V$.
%Similarly, for $V^g\in Gr(H_m^g)$, we identify $g.P_m\otimes V^g$ with its image in $g.P_{m+1}$ under the natural evaluation map. 
%\begin{lemma}
%  \label{le:g equalities}
%  For any $g\in GL_n(\CC)$, the subrepresentation $g.(P_m\otimes V)\subset g.P_{m+1}$ is equal to $g.P_m\otimes V^g\subset g.P_{m+1}$ and the subrepresentation $\phi_{m+1,g}^{-1}(g.P_m\otimes V^g)\subset P_{m+1}$ is equal to $P_m\otimes g.V\subset P_{m+1}$.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%  The first equality is immediate from the definitions.
%  The second equality also follows from the definitions by observing that $\phi_{m+1,g}(P_m\otimes g.V)=g.P_m\otimes V^g$.
%\end{proof}
Following Lemma~\ref{le:injective evaluation maps} we define the following.
\begin{definition}
  For $V\in Gr(H_m)$, define the \emph{truncated preprojective} $P_{m+1}^V$ to be the cokernel of the map $ev_V:P_m\otimes V\to P_{m+1}$, i.e.\ we have a short exact sequence
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:truncated preprojectives}
    0\longrightarrow P_m\otimes V\stackrel{ev_V}{\longrightarrow} P_{m+1}\stackrel{\pi_V}{\longrightarrow} P_{m+1}^V\longrightarrow 0.
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  It will be convenient to also set $P_{m+1}^0=P_{m+1}$, observe that this notation is consistent with taking $V=0$ in the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives}.
\end{remark}

%Any subrepresentation $E\subset P_{m+1}^V$ corresponds by taking pullbacks to a chain of inclusions $P_m\otimes V\subset\tilde E\subset P_{m+1}$.
\begin{proposition}\label{indecomposables}Let $m\geq 1$. Let $\alpha(m,r)=\dim P_{m+1}-r\dim P_m$ with $0\leq r\leq n-1$. Let $R_\alpha(K(n))$ be the affine space of representations of dimension $\alpha(m,r)$. The following holds:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The isomorphism classes of indecomposable representations of dimension $\alpha(m,r)$ are in one-to-one correspondence to points of $\Gr_{n-r}(\CC^n)$.
\item The set indecomposable representations of dimension $\alpha(m,r)$ ist given by a non-empty open subset of $R_\alpha(K(n))$. 
\item The action of $\Gl_n(\CC)$ is transitive on $\mathrm{Ind}(K(n),\alpha(m,r))$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}

As the reflection functors $\Sigma_1,\,\Sigma_2$ preserve indecomposability and as we have $\Sigma_2(\alpha(m,r))=\alpha(m+1,r)$, it suffices to prove the first statement for $m=1$. Then we have $\alpha(m,r)=(1,d)$ for $d:=n-r$. This means that $M\in R_\alpha(K(n))$ is given by a matrix $M\in\CC^{d\times n}$ where the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ column stands for $M_{a_i}$. Now $M$ is indecomposable if and only if $\rk{M}=d$. Indeed, it is clear that $S_1^{m}$ splits up if and only if $\rk{M}=d-m$.

This shows that the indecomposable representations in $R_{\alpha(1,d)}(K(n))$  are in one-to-one correspondence with matrices of maximal rank. Thus they are in one-to-one correspondence to subspaces of $\CC^n$ of dimension $d$ spanned by the column vectors of $M$. Now it straightforward to check that the $\Gl_\alpha=\CC^\ast\times\Gl_d(\CC)$-action on $R_\alpha(K(n))$ corresponds to the base change action of $\Gl_d(\CC)$ on the set of subspaces. This shows the first statement.

It can be checked straightforwardly that $\alpha(1,d)$ is a Schur root because all indecomposable representations have trivial endomorphism ring. Thus the roots $\alpha(m,d)$ are also Schur roots. It follows that the set of indecomposable representations with trivial endomorphism ring form a dense open subset of $R_{\alpha(m,r)}(K(n))$, see for example \cite{sch}. This shows the second statement.

For $m=1$, the action of $\Gl_n(\CC)$ on $\Gr_d(\CC^n)$ is transitive which shows that it is transitive on $\Ind_\alpha(K(n))$. As the reflection functors preserve indecomposability and isomorphism classes, by Lemma \ref{compatibleGSigma}, for every $g\in\Gl_n(\CC)$, we obtain a commutative diagram
\[\xymatrix{\Ind(K(n),\alpha(m,r))\ar[r]^{\Sigma_2}\ar[d]^{g^{-T}}&\Ind(K(n),\alpha(m+1,r))\ar[d]^g\\
\Ind(K(n),\alpha(m,r))\ar[r]^{\Sigma_2}&\Ind(K(n),\alpha(m+1,r))}\]
As the $\Gl_n(\CC)$-action is transitive on the left hand side, this implies that it is also transitive on the right hand side.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}There is a more elegant way to prove Proposition \ref{indecomposables} using the notion of stability and moduli spaces. Actually, fixing the standard stability induced by the linear form $\Theta(\alpha)=\alpha_2$, it can be shown that all indecomposables are stable and that the moduli space of stable representation is in fact $\Gr_d(\CC^n)$. We inserted this proof because the notion of stability were only used at this point and we wanted to keep this part as simple as possible. 
\end{remark}


\begin{theorem}
  The quiver Grassmannian $Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^V)$ is smooth for each dimension vector $\bfe$ and each $V\in Gr(H_m)$.
  Moreover, for $V,W\in Gr_d(H_m)$, we have $Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^V)\cong Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^W)$ for all dimension vectors $\bfe$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $g\in\Gl_n(\CC)$. We first show that $\Gr_\bfe(g.P_{m+1}^V)=\Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^V)$. Assume that $P_{m+1}^V$ is given by the linear maps $M_{a_i}$. Then $g.P_{m+1}^V$ is given by the matrices $M'_{a_i}=\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}M_{a_j}$. Let $(U_1,U_2)\in\Gr_\bfe(g.P_{m+1}^V)$. Then we have  
\[M_{a_i}(U_2)\subset U_1 \text{ for all } i=1,\ldots,n\Leftrightarrow \left(\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}M_{a_j}\right)(U_2)\subset U_1 \text{ for all } i=1,\ldots,n.\]
Note that we have $g^{-1}.(g.P_{m+1}^V)=P_{m+1}^V$ which shows the non-obvious direction.

Together with Proposition \ref{indecomposables} this shows that all quiver Grassmannians $\Gr_\bfe(M)$ for a fixed $\bfe\in\NN^{Q_0}$ where $M\in\Ind(K(n),\udim P_{m+1}^V)$ are isomorphic. With other words we use that all indecomposables are truncated preprojectives.

As the indecomposables form a dense open subset of all representations, we found a dense subset whose quiver Grassmannians for a fixed $\bfe$ are isomorphic. But now the same proof as for exceptional roots applies in order to show that these quiver Grassmannians need to be smooth, see \cite[Corollary 4]{cr}.
 % \footnote{The proof using moduli spaces needs to be written}
  %Both claims are proven via the same geometric construction.
  %For each dimension vector $\bfe$, there is a smooth variety
  %\[X_{\bfe,m}=\{(\tilde E,V):V\in Gr_d(H_m),\ P_m\otimes V\subset\tilde E\subset P_{m+1}i,\ \udim\tilde E=\bfe+d\udim P_m\}.\]
  %Under the natural projection $\pi:X_{\bfe,m}\to Gr_d(H_m)$, the fiber $\pi^{-1}(V)$ identifies with $Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^V)$.
  %In particular, this implies $Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^V)$ is smooth for each $V\in Gr_d(H_m)$.

  %The variety $X_{\bfe,m}$ supports an action of $GL_n(\CC)$ by setting $g.(\tilde E,V)=\big(\phi_{m+1,g}^{-1}(g.\tilde E),g.V\big)$.
  %Indeed, by Lemma~\ref{le:g equalities} we have 
  %\[P_m\otimes g.V=\phi_{m+1,g}^{-1}(g.P_m\otimes V^g)=\phi_{m+1,g}^{-1}\big(g.(P_m\otimes V)\big)\subset\phi_{m+1,g}^{-1}(g.\tilde E).\]
  %Observe that the projection map $\pi$ is $GL_n(\CC)$-equivariant and thus by Lemma~\ref{le:transitivity} the quiver Grassmannians $Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^V)$ and $Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^W)$ are isomorphic for any $V,W\in Gr_d(H_m)$.
\end{proof}


%\begin{lemma}
%  For any $m\ge1$, we have 
%  \[\dim\Hom(P_m,P_m)=1,\quad \dim\Hom(P_m,P_{m+1})=n,\quad \dim\Hom(P_{m+1},P_m)=0, \quad\dim\Ext(P_{m+1},P_m)=0.\]  
%  Moreover, for $1\le k<n$ and linearly independent functions $f_1,\ldots,f_k\in\Hom(P_m,P_{m+1})$, the map $[f_1\ \cdots\ f_k]:P_m^k\to P_{m+1}$ is injective. 
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof} 
%  Note that we have an Auslander-Reiten sequence
%  \begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:AR sequence}
%    0\longrightarrow P_{m-1}\stackrel{\iota_{m-1}}{\longrightarrow} P_m^n\stackrel{[f_1\ \cdots\ f_n]}{\longrightarrow} P_{m+1}\longrightarrow 0
%  \end{equation}
%  with irreducible homomorphisms $f_i$ which are also linearly independent. 
%  Thus they do not factor through a representation $Z\neq P_{m}$ which already means that they are injective, see for instance \cite[Lemma 1.6]{ass}. 
%  If we pick $k<n$ linearly independent homomorphisms $f_{i_1},\ldots, f_{i_k}$, this also means that $[f_{i_1}\ \cdots\ f_{i_k}]:P_m^k\to P_{m+1}$ is injective. 
%  Indeed otherwise, at least one of the homomorphisms would be forced to factor through a representation $Z\neq P_{m}$.
%\end{proof}
%\begin{remark}
%  Fix a basis $\{f_{m,1},\ldots,f_{m,n}\}$ for $\Hom(P_m,P_{m+1})$, $m\ge2$.
%  Define a basis $\{f_{\ell,1},\ldots,f_{\ell,n}\}$ for each $\Hom(P_\ell,P_{\ell+1})$, $1\le\ell\le m-1$, by downward induction as follows.  
%  Write $\iota_\ell:P_\ell\to P_{\ell+1}^n$ for the left-hand morphism from the sequence \eqref{eq:AR sequence} computed using $f_k=f_{\ell+1,k}$, $1\le k\le n$. 
%  Then the basis element $f_{\ell,k}$ is given by composing $\iota_\ell$ with the coordinate projection $\pi_k:P_{\ell+1}^n\to P_{\ell+1}$ onto the $k$-th factor.
%  Indeed, applying $\Hom(-,P_{\ell+1})$ to this sequence \eqref{eq:AR sequence} gives an isomorphism $\Hom(P_{\ell+1}^n,P_{\ell+1})\cong\Hom(P_\ell,P_{\ell+1})$ whereby the natural basis of coordinate projections on the left is taken to the basis $\{f_{\ell,k}\}$ on the right.
%\end{remark}

For each $m\ge2$, there is an Auslander-Reiten sequence \cite{auslander-reiten-smalo}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:AR sequence}
  0\longrightarrow P_{m-1}\stackrel{\iota_{m-1}}{\longrightarrow} P_m\otimes H_m\stackrel{ev}{\longrightarrow} P_{m+1}\longrightarrow 0,
\end{equation}
where the right-hand morphism is the natural evaluation map.
\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:preprojective homomorphism duality}
  The sequence \eqref{eq:AR sequence} gives rise to an isomorphism $H_m^*\cong H_{m-1}$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Define a map $H_m^*\to H_{m-1}$ by $\varphi\mapsto\bar{\varphi}:=(id\overline{\otimes}\varphi)\circ\iota_{m-1}$, in words $\bar{\varphi}$ acts on $x\in P_{m-1}$ by contracting with the second factor in $\iota_{m-1}(x)$ to give an element of $P_m$.
  Suppose $\varphi\in H_m^*$ is a nonzero functional on $H_m$ and let $V\subsetneq H_m$ denote the kernel of $\varphi$.
  Then $\bar{\varphi}=0\in H_{m-1}$ if and only if the image of $\iota_{m-1}$ is contained in $P_m\otimes V\subsetneq P_m\otimes H_m$.
  But then Lemma~\ref{le:injective evaluation maps} implies $\iota_{m-1}$ is the zero map, a contradiction.
  Thus the map $H_m^*\to H_{m-1}$, $\varphi\mapsto\bar{\varphi}$ must be injective and hence an isomorphism.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
  The set $Gr(H_m)$ is naturally a poset and Corollary~\ref{cor:preprojective homomorphism duality} gives an identification of the opposite poset $Gr(H_m)^{op}\cong Gr(H_m^*)$ with $Gr(H_{m-1})$.
  We write $\bar{V}\subset H_{m-1}$ for the subspace corresponding to $V\subset H_m$ under this identification.
  Under the isomorphism of $H_{m-1}$ with $H_m^*$, we have $\bar{V}=(H_m/V)^*$.
\end{remark}
Following Remark~\ref{rem:reflection recursion}, the reflection functor $\Sigma_1$ provides a natural identification of $H_m$ with $H_{m-1}$ for $m\ge2$. 
Combining with Corollary~\ref{cor:preprojective homomorphism duality} we obtain a natural isomorphism $H_m^*\cong H_m$ for $m\ge2$.
The next observation is essential for the results to follow.
\begin{proposition}
  For $V\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, we have $\bar{\bar{V}}=\tau V$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  We show that $\bar{\bar{\varphi}}=\tau\varphi$ for $\varphi\in H_m$.
  Indeed, we have
  \[\bar{\bar{\varphi}}=(id\overline{\otimes}\bar{\varphi})\circ\iota_{m-2}=\Big(id\overline{\otimes}\big((id\overline{\otimes}\varphi)\circ\iota_{m-1}\big)\Big)\circ\iota_{m-2}.\]
\end{proof}





\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:basic homological properties}
  For $V\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, we have $\Hom(P_{m+1}^V,P_\ell)=0=\Ext(P_\ell,P_{m+1}^V)$ for all $\ell\ge1$.
  Moreover, $\Hom(P_{m+1},P_{m+1}^V)$ is the one-dimensional space spanned by the natural projection $\pi_V:P_{m+1}\to P_{m+1}^V$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The first claim is immediate since $\Hom(X,P_\ell)\ne0$ (resp. $\Ext(P_\ell,X)\ne0$) for some $\ell\ge1$ implies all indecomposable summands of $X$ are preprojectives of the form $P_r$ with $1\le r\le\ell$ (resp. $1\le r\le\ell-2$), whereas $P_{m+1}^V$ is not preprojective.
  For the second claim we apply the functor $\Hom(P_{m+1},-)$ to the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives} and obtain an isomorphism $\Hom(P_{m+1},P_{m+1})\cong\Hom(P_{m+1},P_{m+1}^V)$ by which the identity map on $P_{m+1}$ is taken to the projection $\pi_V:P_{m+1}\to P_{m+1}^V$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  For $V\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, the truncated preprojective $P_{m+1}^V$ is indecomposable.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Applying the functor $\Hom(-,P_{m+1}^V)$ to the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives} gives an injective map from $\Hom(P_{m+1}^V,P_{m+1}^V)$ to the one-dimensional space $\Hom(P_{m+1},P_{m+1}^V)$.
  In particular, the endomorphism ring of $P_{m+1}^V$ is one-dimensional and so $P_{m+1}^V$ must be indecomposable.
\end{proof}

The total Grassmannian $Gr(H_m)$ is naturally a poset under inclusion which we extend to a $\CC$-linear category $\CC Gr(H_m)$ with objects the elements of $Gr(H_m)$ and at most one morphism (up to scalars) between any two objects.
Write $\cP_{m+1}$ for the full subcategory of $\rep K(n)$ with objects the truncated preprojectives $P_{m+1}^V$ for $V\in Gr(H_m)$.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:unique morphisms}
  The functor $V\mapsto P_{m+1}^V$ gives an isomorphism of categories $\CC Gr(H_m)\cong\cP_{m+1}$.
  In particular, there exists a morphism $P_{m+1}^W\to P_{m+1}^V$ for $V,W\in Gr(H_m)$ if and only if $W\subset V$ and this morphism is unique (up to scalars) when it exists.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Given $V,W\in Gr(H_m)$, we apply the functor $\Hom(-,P_{m+1}^V)$ to the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives} for $W$ to get an exact sequence
  \[0\longrightarrow \Hom(P_{m+1}^W,P_{m+1}^V)\longrightarrow \Hom(P_{m+1},P_{m+1}^V)\stackrel{-\circ ev_W}{\longrightarrow} \Hom(P_m\otimes W,P_{m+1}^V).\]
  But the space $\Hom(P_{m+1},P_{m+1}^V)$ is one-dimensional, spanned by the natural projection $\pi_V:P_{m+1}\to P_{m+1}^V$, and thus $\Hom(P_{m+1}^W,P_{m+1}^V)$ is nonzero if and only if the right hand morphism of the above sequence is zero.
  But this occurs exactly when the image of $ev_W:P_m\otimes W\to P_{m+1}$ is contained in the kernel of $\pi_V$, i.e.\ in the image of $ev_V:P_m\otimes V\to P_{m+1}$, and this occurs if and only if $W\subset V$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:irreducible morphisms}
  For $V\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, and $W\subsetneq V$ with $\codim_V W=1$, the unique morphism $P_{m+1}^W\to P_{m+1}^V$ is irreducible.
\end{lemma}
In particular, the poset $Gr(H_m)$, thought of as a directed graph, can be identified with a subset of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of $K(n)$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:truncated homomorphisms}
  For $V\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, we have $\Hom(P_m,P_{m+1}^V)\cong H_m/V$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Applying the functor $\Hom(P_m,-)$ to the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives} gives an exact sequence
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & \Hom(P_m,P_m\otimes V) \ar[r] & \Hom(P_m,P_{m+1}) \ar[r] & \Hom(P_m,P_{m+1}^V) \ar[r] & 0}.\]
  But there is a natural isomorphism $\Hom(P_m,P_m\otimes V)\cong V$ and the result follows.
\end{proof}
  
\begin{corollary}
    For $V,W\in Gr(H_m)$ with $V\subset W$, we have $\Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_{m+1}^W)\cong V^*\otimes(H_m/W)$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Applying the functor $\Hom(-,P_{m+1}^W)$ to the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives} gives an injective map $\Hom(P_{m+1}^V,P_{m+1}^W)\to\Hom(P_{m+1},P_{m+1}^W)$ which is an isomorphism by Lemma~\ref{le:basic homological properties} and Lemma~\ref{le:unique morphisms}.
  Since $\Ext(P_{m+1},P_{m+1}^W)=0$ again by Lemma~\ref{le:basic homological properties}, it follows that there is an isomorphism 
  \[\Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_{m+1}^W)\cong\Hom(P_m\otimes V,P_{m+1}^W)\cong V^*\otimes H_m/W,\]
  where the last isomorphism is immediate from Lemma~\ref{le:truncated homomorphisms}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:truncated extensions}
  For $V\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, we have $\Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_m)\cong V^*$, where each nontrivial extension naturally corresponds to a codimension 1 subspace $U\subset V$. 
  More precisely, each element of $\Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_m)$ corresponds to an exact sequence
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & P_m \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^U \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0},\]
where $U\subset V$ satisfies $\dim(V/U)=1$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Consider a nonzero map $\varphi\in V^*$ and set $U=\ker\varphi\subset V$.
  There is a natural isomorphism $V^*\cong\Hom(P_m\otimes V,P_m)$ which takes $\varphi$ to $id\overline{\otimes}\varphi$.
  This gives rise to the following commutative diagram:
  \[\xymatrix{ & 0 \ar[d] & 0 \ar[d] & & \\
    & P_m\otimes U \ar@{=}[r]\ar[d] & P_m\otimes U \ar[d] & & \\
    0 \ar[r] & P_m\otimes V \ar[d]^{id\overline{\otimes}\varphi}\ar[r]\ar@{}[dr]|(.7){\lrcorner}\ar@{}[dr]|(.3){\ulcorner} & P_{m+1} \ar[r]\ar[d] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r]\ar@{=}[d] & 0\\
    0 \ar[r] & P_m \ar[r]\ar[d] & P_{m+1}^U \ar[r]\ar[d] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0\\
   & 0 & 0 & & }\]
  By Lemma~\ref{le:basic homological properties}, we may apply the functor $\Hom(-,P_m)$ to the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives} to get the isomorphism 
  \[\Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_m)\cong\Hom(P_m\otimes V,P_m)\cong V^*.\]
  Under this isomorphism, the functional $\varphi$ corresponds to the lower pushout sequence in the above diagram.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:unique truncated extension}
  For $V\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge2$, the space $\Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_{m-1})$ is one-dimensional and spanned by the extension
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:unique extension}
    \xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & P_{m-1} \ar[r]^(.375){\kappa_V} & P_m\otimes(H_m/V) \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0}.
  \end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Applying the functor $\Hom(-,P_{m-1})$ to the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives} gives an isomorphism $\Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_{m-1})\cong\Ext(P_{m+1},P_{m-1})$ with a one-dimensional space.
  Writing $X$ for the unique extension of $P_{m+1}^V$ by $P_{m-1}$, this isomorphism gives rise to the following pullback diagram:
  \[\xymatrix{ & & 0 \ar[d] & 0\ar[d] & \\
    & & P_m\otimes V \ar@{=}[r]\ar[d] & P_m\otimes V\ar[d] & \\
    0 \ar[r] & P_{m-1} \ar@{=}[d]\ar[r]^(.425){\iota_{m-1}} & P_m\otimes H_m \ar[r]\ar[d]\ar@{}[dr]|(.7){\lrcorner} & P_{m+1} \ar[r]\ar[d] & 0\\
    0 \ar[r] & P_{m-1} \ar[r]^{\kappa_V} & X \ar[r]\ar[d] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r]\ar[d] & 0\\
    & & 0 & 0 & }\]
  from which we immediately obtain the isomorphism $X\cong P_m\otimes(H_m/V)$.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:truncated preprojective isomorphism}
  Suppose $V\in Gr(H_m)$ has codimension one in $H_m$.  Then $P_{m+1}^V\cong P_m^{\bar{V}}$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  By Lemma~\ref{le:unique truncated extension}, we have the exact sequence
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & P_{m-1} \ar[r]^(.35){\kappa_V} & P_m\otimes(H_m/V) \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0}.\]
  But $H_m/V$ is a one-dimensional vector space and so $P_m\otimes(H_m/V)\cong P_m$.
  Under this identification, the left hand morphism $\kappa_V$ in the sequence above identifies with a generator of $\bar{V}$ and thus $P_{m+1}^V\cong P_m^{\bar{V}}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  For $V,W\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge3$, the space $\Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_{m-1}^{\bar{\bar{W}}})$ has dimension 0 or 1.. .
\end{corollary}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:more truncated homomorphisms}
  For $W\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge2$, the following hold:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\Hom(P_{m-1},P_m^{\bar{W}})\cong W^*$;
    \item $\Hom(P_{m+1},P_m^{\bar{W}})\cong (H_m/W)^*$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By Corollary~\ref{cor:preprojective homomorphism duality}, we have $H_{m-1}\cong H_m^*$ and $\bar{W}\cong(H_m/W)^*$.
  Then Lemma~\ref{le:truncated homomorphisms} gives the isomorphism
  \[\Hom(P_{m-1},P_m^{\bar{W}})\cong H_{m-1}/\bar{W}\cong H_m^*/(H_m/W)^*\cong W^*.\]

  Applying the functor $\Hom(-,P_m^{\bar{W}})$ to the sequence \eqref{eq:AR sequence} we get an exact sequence 
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & \Hom(P_{m+1},P_m^{\bar{W}}) \ar[r] & \Hom(P_m\otimes H_m,P_m^{\bar{W}}) \ar[r] & \Hom(P_{m-1},P_m^{\bar{W}}) \ar[r] & 0}.\]
  By Lemma~\ref{le:basic homological properties}, the middle space above is isomorphic to $H_m^*$ and thus $\Hom(P_{m+1},P_m^{\bar{W}})$ can be identified with the kernel of the natural map $H_m^*\to W^*$, i.e.\ with the space $(H_m/W)^*$.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
  For $W\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge2$, a nonzero element $\varphi\in\Hom(P_{m+1},P_m^{\bar{W}})=(H_m/W)^*$ corresponds, by taking the kernel of $\varphi$, to a codimension 1 subspace $V\subset H_m$ containing $W$.
  Then the map $\varphi$ is (up to scalars) the composition of the natural projection $\pi_V:P_{m+1}\to P_{m+1}^V$, the isomorphism $P_{m+1}^V\cong P_m^{\bar{V}}$ from Corollary~\ref{cor:truncated preprojective isomorphism}, and the unique projection $P_m^{\bar{V}}\to P_m^{\bar{W}}$.
\end{remark}
\begin{corollary}
  For $V,W\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge2$, we have natural isomorphisms 
  \[\Hom(P_{m+1}^V,P_m^{\bar{W}})\cong\big(H_m/(V+W)\big)^*\quad\text{and}\quad\Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_m^{\bar{W}})\cong(V\cap W)^*.\]
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Applying the functor $\Hom(-,P_m^{\bar{W}})$ to the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives} we get an exact sequence
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & \Hom(P_{m+1}^V,P_m^{\bar{W}}) \ar[r] & \Hom(P_{m+1},P_m^{\bar{W}}) \ar[r] & \Hom(P_m\otimes V,P_m^{\bar{W}}) \ar[r] & \Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_m^{\bar{W}}) \ar[r] & 0}.\]
  By Lemma~\ref{le:more truncated homomorphisms}, we may identify $\Hom(P_{m+1}^V,P_m^{\bar{W}})$ and $\Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_m^{\bar{W}})$ with the kernel and cokernel of the natural map $(H_m/W)^*\to V^*$.
  The result immediately follows from this.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
  It is slightly easier to understand the dual of the diagram figuring in the proof above, in particular it is immediate that the kernel of the natural morphism $V\to H_m/W$ is $V\cap W$ while the cokernel of this morphism is $H_m/(V+W)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
  For $V,W\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge2$, with $\dim W=1$, we have $\Hom(P_{m+1}^V,P_{m-1}^{\bar{\bar{W}}})\cong\big(H_m/(V+W)\big)^*$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
  For $m\ge2$ and $V\in Gr(H_m)$, the Auslander-Reiten translate of the truncated preprojective $P_{m+1}^V$ is again a truncated preprojective representation of $K(n)$.  More precisely, we have $\tau(P_{m+1}^V)=P_{m-1}^{\bar{\bar{V}}}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Under the Auslander-Reiten translation, the subspace $V\subset H_m$ is taken to a subspace $\tilde V\subset H_{m-2}$ of the same dimension.
  It follows that the evaluation morphism $P_m\otimes V\stackrel{ev_V}{\longrightarrow} P_{m+1}$ transforms via $\tau$ to the evaluation morphism $P_{m-2}\otimes\tilde V\stackrel{ev_{\tilde V}}{\longrightarrow} P_{m-1}$.
  Thus the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives} transforms via $\tau$ to the exact sequence
  \[0\longrightarrow P_{m-2}\otimes \tilde V\stackrel{ev_{\tilde V}}{\longrightarrow} P_{m-1}\stackrel{\pi_{\tilde V}}{\longrightarrow} P_{m-1}^{\tilde V}\longrightarrow 0.\]
  This proves the first claim.

  It remains to show that $\tilde V=\bar{\bar{V}}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:truncated exact sequences}
  For $V\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge2$, each nontrivial direct sum decomposition $V=U\oplus W$ gives rise to an exact sequence
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & P_{m+1} \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^U\oplus P_{m+1}^W \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0}\]
  representing a distinct class in $\Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_{m+1})$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Given a nontrivial direct sum decomposition $V=U\oplus W$, we may identify $U=V/W$ and $W=V/U$ to get the following commutative diagram:
  \[\xymatrix{ & & 0 \ar[d] & 0 \ar[d] & \\
    & & P_m\otimes U \ar@{=}[r]\ar[d] & P_m\otimes(V/W) \ar[d] & \\
    0 \ar[r] & P_m\otimes W \ar@{=}[d]\ar[r] & P_{m+1} \ar[r]\ar[d]\ar@{}[dr]|(.7){\lrcorner} & P_{m+1}^W \ar[d]\ar[r] & 0 \\
    0 \ar[r] & P_m\otimes(V/U) \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^U \ar[r]\ar[d] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r]\ar[d] & 0\\
    & & 0 & 0 & }\]
  Since the left vertical morphism (or upper horizontal morphism) is an equality, the lower right square is a pullback.
  It follows that the sequence
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & P_{m+1} \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^U\oplus P_{m+1}^W \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V}\]
  is exact.
  But the morphism $P_{m+1}^U\oplus P_{m+1}^W\to P_{m+1}^V$ is clearly surjective and thus we obtain an element of $\Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_{m+1})$.

  For the final claim we observe that, for another direct sum decomposition $V=U'\oplus W'$, the representations $P_{m+1}^U\oplus P_{m+1}^W$ and $P_{m+1}^{U'}\oplus P_{m+1}^{W'}$ are isomorphic if and only if the direct sum decompositions $V=U\oplus W$ and $V=U'\oplus W'$ are the same up to permutation of summands.
\end{proof}

For $V\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, any subspace $W\subset V$ gives rise to an exact sequence
\[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & P_m\otimes(V/W) \ar[r]^(.6){ev} & P_{m+1}^W \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0},\]
where the left hand morphism above is the natural evaluation morphism coming from Lemma~\ref{le:truncated homomorphisms}.
Each such sequence has the following almost-split property for proper subrepresentations of $P_{m+1}^V$.
\begin{lemma}
  For $V\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, given any proper subrepresentation $X\subsetneq P_{m+1}^V$, the upper pullback sequence
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & P_m\otimes(V/W) \ar@{=}[d]\ar[r] & Y \ar[r]\ar[d]\ar@{}[dr]|(.7){\lrcorner} & X \ar[d]\ar[r] & 0 \\
    0 \ar[r] & P_m\otimes(V/W) \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^W \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0}\]
  splits for every proper subspace $W\subsetneq V$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We proceed by induction on $\codim_V W$.  
  When $\codim_V W=1$, we have an exact sequence
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & P_m\otimes(V/W) \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^W \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0}\] 
  with both morphisms irreducible by Lemma~\ref{le:irreducible morphisms} and the claim immediately follows.

  Suppose $W\subsetneq V$ with $\codim_V W>1$ and choose an intermediate subspace $W\subsetneq T\subsetneq V$.
  Given $X\subsetneq P_{m+1}^V$, we have the pullback diagram
  \[\xymatrix{ Y \ar[d]\ar[r]\ar@{}[dr]|(.7){\lrcorner} & Y' \ar[r]\ar[d]\ar@{}[dr]|(.7){\lrcorner} & X \ar[d]\\
  P_{m+1}^W \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^T \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V}\]
  in which all horizontal morphisms of the upper row are split epimorphisms by induction.
  The result now follows since the outer square is also a pullback.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  Consider $V,W\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, with $W\subset V$.
  Given any proper subrepresentation $X\subsetneq P_{m+1}^V$ and any subrepresentation $Z\subset P_m\otimes(V/W)$, there is a subrepresentation of $P_{m+1}^W$ isomorphic to $Z\oplus X$ which fits into a commutative diagram
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & Z \ar[d]\ar[r] & Z\oplus X \ar[r]\ar[d] & X \ar[d]\ar[r] & 0 \\
    0 \ar[r] & P_m\otimes(V/W) \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^W \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0}\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{lemma}
  For $V\in Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, a subrepresentation $X\subset P_m$ fits into a commutative diagram
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & X \ar[d]\ar[r]\ar@{}[dr]|(.3){\ulcorner} & Y \ar[d]\ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar@{=}[d]\ar[r] & 0 \\
    0 \ar[r] & P_m\otimes(V/U) \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^U \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0}\]
  with $\dim(V/U)=1$ if and only if the lower pushout sequence below splits: 
  \[\xymatrix{ 0\ar[r]& P_m\otimes(V/U) \ar[r] \ar[d]\ar@{}[dr]|(.3){\ulcorner} & P_{m+1}^U \ar[r]\ar[d] & P_{m+1}^V \ar@{=}[d]\ar[r] & 0\\
  0 \ar[r] & P_m\otimes(V/U)/X \ar[r] & Z \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0}.\]
  This occurs (?) if and only if the composed morphism
  \[\xymatrix{X \ar[r] & P_m \ar[r] & P_m^{\bar{V}} \ar[r] & P_{m-1}^{\bar{\bar{V}}}}\]
  is nonzero.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  For a proper subrepresentation $X\subsetneq P_m$ we have the following commutative diagram
  \[\tag{$\dagger$}\xymatrix{ & 0 \ar[r]\ar[d] & \Hom(P_{m+1}^U,P_m/X) \ar[d]\\
    0 \ar[r]\ar[d] & \Hom(P_m,P_m) \ar[r]\ar[d] & \Hom(P_m,P_m/X) \ar[d]\\
    \Ext(P_{m+1}^V,X) \ar[r] & \Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_m) \ar[r] & \Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_m/X)}\]
  From the bottom row of the diagram ($\dagger$), we see that there is a pushout diagram
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & X \ar[d]\ar[r]\ar@{}[dr]|(.3){\ulcorner} & Y \ar[d]\ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar@{=}[d]\ar[r] & 0 \\
    0 \ar[r] & P_m \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^U \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0}\]
  if and only if the lower pushout sequence below splits: 
  \[\xymatrix{ 0\ar[r]& P_m \ar[r]^{\epsilon}\ar[d]_{\rho}\ar@{}[dr]|(.3){\ulcorner} & P_{m+1}^U \ar[r]\ar[d] & P_{m+1}^V \ar@{=}[d]\ar[r] & 0\\
  0 \ar[r] & P_m/X \ar[r] & Z \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0}.\]
  The right hand vertical sequence of the diagram ($\dagger$) then shows that this occurs if and only if the map $\rho:P_m\to P_m/X$ factors through the map $\epsilon:P_m\to P_{m+1}^U$.

  and
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & \Ext(P_{m+1}^V,X) \ar[r] & \Ext(P_{m+1},X) \ar[r] & \Ext(P_m\otimes V,X) \ar[r] &  0}.\]
\end{proof}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Quiver Grassmannians of $\widetilde{K(n)}$}\label{QG}
\noindent 
We fix a natural number $n\geq 3$. We fix the following lifts $\tilde P_m$  of $P_m$ to the universal cover $\widetilde{K(n)}$. For $m=1$ we assume that $\dim (\tilde P_1)_{1,1}=1$ and $\dim (\tilde P_1)_{i,w}=0$ if $(i,w)\neq (1,1)$. Moreover, we assume that $\dim (\tilde P_2)_{2,1}=\dim (\tilde P_2)_{1,w}=1$ for $w=a_1,\ldots,a_n$ and $\dim (\tilde P_2)_{i,w}=0$ if $(i,w)\notin\{(2,1),(1,a_1),\ldots,(1,a_n)\}$. Recall that applying the reflection functor $\Sigma_i$ on $K(n)$ corresponds to applying $\tilde\Sigma_i:=\prod_{w\in W_Q}\Sigma_{(i,w)}$ on $\widetilde{K(n)}$. Moreover, sinks become sources and vice versa. For $m\geq 3$, we can build lifts $\tilde P_m$ recursively by applying reflection functors or as Auslander-Reiten translation, i.e. we have
\begin{align}\label{recursive}\tilde P_m=\tilde\Sigma_2 \tilde P_{m-1},\quad\tilde P_{m+1}=\tilde\Sigma_{1}\tilde\Sigma_2\tilde P_{m-1}=\tau^{-1} \tilde P_{m-1}\text{ for }m\geq 2.\end{align}
It is rather important that $\tilde P_{2m}$ and $\tilde P_{2m-1}$ live on two different components of the universal covering quiver.

\begin{remark}\begin{enumerate}
\item Note that the group $W_Q$ acts naturally on $\widetilde{K(n)}_0$ via translation, i.e. $w.(q,w')=(q,ww')$ inducing an action on $\Rep(\widetilde{K(n)})$. Up to this action a lift $\tilde P_m$ of $P_m$ is unique (on isomorphism classes).
\item Then we have 
$$\tilde P_{2l-1,i}:=a_i.\tilde P_{2l-1},\quad \tilde P_{2l,i}:=a_i^{-1}.\tilde P_{2l}$$
for all $l\geq 1$ and for $i=1,\ldots,n$. This can be checked straightforwardly for $l=1$ and follows in general when applying the identities (\ref{recursive}). 

\item Note that, the lifts $\tilde P_m$ all have the same middle vertex $(i,1)$ where $i=1$ is $m$ is odd and $i=2$ if $m$ is even.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

%To do so, we fix $m$ and the following notation can be seen as relative to $m$\footnote{do we need this?}. 

Every representation $\tilde P_m$ has $n$ subrepresentation $\tilde P_{m-1,1},\ldots,\tilde P_{m-1,n}$. Each of them corresponds to one of the $n$ different arrows of $K(n)$. 

\begin{example}\label{smallm}[The cases $m=2,3,4$]
\end{example}


The representation $\tilde P_2$ is given by the following coefficient quiver:

\begin{align*}\xymatrix@R10pt@C20pt{&&\bullet\\ \bullet\ar^{a_1}[rru]\ar^{a_{n}}[rrd] &&\vdots\\&&\bullet}\end{align*}
The coefficient quiver of $\tilde P_2^{(i)}$, which we denote by $\mathcal A_i$ during this proof, can be obtained from this quiver by erasing the arrow $a_i$ and the corresponding sink. In turn, the quiver of $\tilde P_2^{(j_1,\ldots,j_l)}$ is obtained by erasing the arrows $a_{j_1},\ldots, a_{j_l}$.

Using this notation, we obtain that $\tilde P_3$ can be written as
	\begin{align*}\xymatrix@R10pt@C20pt{&&\mathcal A_1\ar_{a_{1}}[lld]\\ n-1 &&\vdots\\&&\mathcal A_n\ar_{a_{n}}[llu]}\end{align*}
	and, moreover, $\tilde P_3^{\uj}$ is obtained when erasing the subquiver $\mathcal A_{j_1},\ldots,\mathcal A_{j_l}$ and decreasing the dimension of the sink by one.  The Auslander-Reiten translate $\tau\tilde P_{3}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_l)}$ is given by
	\begin{align*}\xymatrix@R10pt@C20pt{&&\bullet\ar_{a_{j_1}}[lld]\\\bullet &&\vdots\\&&\bullet\ar_{a_{j_l}}[llu]}\end{align*}
In particular, the image of the unique homomorphism $\tilde P_{2,j_l}=a_{j_l}.\tilde P_2\to\tau\tilde P_{3}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_l)}$ has image $\bullet\xrightarrow{a_{j_l}}\bullet$.
 

The support of $\tilde P_4$ is given by
\[\xymatrix@R40pt@C10pt{&&&&&&n-1\ar^{a_1}[llllld]\ar^{a_2}[ld]\ar^{a_n}[rrrrd]&&&&&\\&2n-3&&&&2n-3&&\hdots&&&2n-3\\
\mathcal A_2\ar^{a_2}[ru]&\hdots&\mathcal A_n\ar^{a_n}[lu]&\mathcal A_1\ar^{a_1}[rru]&\widehat{\mathcal A_2}&\mathcal A_3\ar[u]^{a_3}&\hdots&\mathcal A_n\ar^{a_n}[llu]	&\hdots&\mathcal A_2\ar^{a_2}[ru]&\hdots&\mathcal A_{n-1}\ar^{a_{n-1}}[lu]}\]
where the numbers correspond to the dimensions of the respective vertices. Moreover, all dimensions on the subquivers $\mathcal A_i$ are one. The arrows connecting a quiver $\mathcal A_i$ to a sink of the remaining quiver start at the unique source of $\mathcal A_i$. Now $\tilde P_{3,l}$ can be found as the representation corresponding to the subquiver
\[\xymatrix@R40pt@C10pt{&&&&&&1\ar^{a_1}[llllld]\ar^{a_{l-1}}[ld]\ar^{a_l}[d]\ar^{a_{l+1}}[rd]\ar^{a_n}[rrrrd]&&&&&\\&1&&\hdots&&1&n-1&1&\hdots&&&1\\
&&&\mathcal A_1\ar^{a_1}[rrru]&\hdots&\mathcal A_{l-1}\ar_{a_{l-1}}[ru]&\widehat{\mathcal A_l}&\mathcal A_{l+1}\ar_{a_{l+1}}[lu]&\hdots&\mathcal A_n\ar_{a_n}[lllu]	&&&&}\]


Finally, the quiver corresponding to $\tilde P_4^{(1,\ldots,l)}$ is given by

\[\xymatrix@R45pt@C10pt{&&&&&&n-1-l\ar_{a_1}[llllld]\ar^{a_{l}}[llld]\ar^{a_{l+1}}[lld]\ar^{a_n}[rrrrd]&&&&&\\&n-1-l&\hdots&n-1-l&2n-3-l&&\hdots&&\hdots&&2n-3-l\\
&\mathcal A_1\ar^{a_1}[rrru]&\hdots&\mathcal A_l\ar[ru]^{a_l}&\widehat{A}_{l+1}&\mathcal A_{l+2}\ar^{a_{l+2}}[lu]	&\hdots&\mathcal A_n\ar^{a_n}[lllu]&&\mathcal A_2\ar^{a_2}[ru]&\hdots&\mathcal A_{n-1}\ar^{a_{n-1}}[lu]}\]
Now it is straightforward to see that $\tau \tilde P_4^{(1,\ldots,l)}=\tilde P_2^{(1,\ldots,l)}$, where $\tau^{-1}$ is given by reflecting at all the sinks first and at all sources afterwards. Actually, $\tilde P_2^{(1,\ldots,l)}$  is supported at the source lying in the upper row and the $n-l$ sinks connected to it by the arrows $a_{l+1},\ldots,a_n$.

\begin{remark}
Actually, these examples already show how the (truncated) preprojectives are built, also using the identities (\ref{recursive}). We should point out that the case $m=3$ is rather special because it is the only case for which the unique morphism $\tilde P_{2,j_l}\to\tau\tilde P_3^{\uj}$ is not surjective. Note that if we factor out the image of this morphism, the remaining representation is a direct sum of simple injective representations which disappear after reflecting at the source.
\end{remark}


The next step is to introduce notation in order to locate truncated preprojectives as quotients of other truncated preprojectives in the universal covering for general $m$.
With every sequence of natural numbers $\ui=(i_1,\ldots,i_k)$ with $i_j\leq n$ and $k\leq m-1$, we can associate a preprojective subrepresentation $\tilde P_{m-k,\uj}$ of dimension $(u_{m-k},u_{m-k-1})$. More detailed, we obtain a sequence of preprojective representations 
$$\tilde P_{m-k,\ui}\subset P_{m-k+1,(i_1,\ldots,i_{k-1})}\subset\ldots\subset P_{m-1,(i_1,i_2)}\subset P_{m-1,i_1}\subset P_{m}.$$
  
Let
$$I^n_l:=\{(j_1,\ldots,j_{l})\mid j_i\in\{1,\ldots,n\},\,j_i\neq j_k\text{ if }i\neq k\}.$$
As we fixed the number of arrows, we drop the $n$ in what follows. For $\uj=(j_1,\ldots,j_{n-1})\in I_{n-1}$, let $j^c\in \{1,\ldots,n\}$ and $\uj^c=(j^c)$ where $j^c\neq j_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,n-1$. Clearly, $\uj^c$ is uniquely determined by $\uj$.



\begin{definition}Let ${\bf j}:=(\underline{j_1},\underline{j_2},\ldots,\underline{j_r})$ be a sequence with $\underline{j_1}\in I_{n-1}$, $\underline{j_2},\ldots,\underline{j_{r-1}}\in I_{n-2}$ and $\underline{j_r}\in I_s$ for $s\leq n-2$. Define $j_1^c$ as before.
 We say that ${\bf j}$ is admissible if 
$$ j_{k,i}\neq j_{k-1}^{c}\text{ for all }k=2,\ldots, r-1,\,i=1,\ldots,n-2\text{ and for }i=1,\ldots,s\text{ if }k=r$$
where $j_k^c\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$ for $2\leq k\leq r-1$ is recursively defined as the unique number satisfying $j_k^c\neq j_{k,i}$ for $i=1,\ldots,n-2$ and $j_k^c\neq j_{k-1}^c$. 
\end{definition}


For $\uj\in I_{l}$ with $l\leq n-1$, there exist unique short exact sequences 
\[\ses{\bigoplus_{i=1}^l\tilde P_{m-1,j_i}}{\tilde P_m}{\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}},\quad\quad\ses{\tilde P_{m-1,j_l}}{\tilde P_{m}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_{l-1})}}{\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}}\]
where the $\tilde P_m^{\uj}$ are lifts of truncated preprojectives (as defined in the last section). The next step is to define a unique truncated preprojective representation for each admissible sequence ${\bf j}=(\underline{j_1},\underline{j_2},\ldots,\underline{j_r})$. We define the admissible sequence $\delta {\bf j}$ (of length $r-1$) by
\[\delta {\bf j}:=((j_1^c,\underline{j_2}),\ldots,\underline{j_r}).\]
We recursively define $\delta^i{\bf j}$ for $i=1,\dots,r-1$.
%In the following, we assume without loss of generality that $i_1< i_2<\ldots< i_k$.
Note that we have $\delta\uj=(j^c)$ for $\uj\in I_{n-1}$.

\begin{lemma}The following holds:
  \label{le:preprojective lifts}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For $m\geq 2$, we have $\Hom_Q(P_{m-1},P_m)\cong\bigoplus_{i=1}^n \Hom_{\tilde Q}(\tilde P_{m-1,i},\tilde P_m)$, where each $\Hom_{\tilde Q}(\tilde P_{m-1,i},\tilde P_m)$ is one-dimensional;
   % \item For any proper subset $\{i_1,\ldots,i_k\}\subset\{1,\ldots,n\}$, there exists a short exact sequence
   %   \[0\longrightarrow \tilde P_{m-1,i_1}\oplus\cdots\oplus\tilde P_{m-1,i_k}\longrightarrow\tilde P_m\longrightarrow \tilde P_m^{i_1,\ldots,i_k}\longrightarrow 0;\]
    \item For $m\geq 1$, the representations $\tilde P_{m,i}$ are pairwise orthogonal, i.e. for $i\neq k$ we have $$\Hom(\tilde P_{m,i},\tilde P_{m,k})=\Ext(\tilde P_{m,i},\tilde P_{m,k})=0;$$
    \item If $\uj\in I_{n-1}$ and $m\geq 3$, we have $\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}\cong \tilde P_{m-1,j^c}^{\uj^c}= \tilde P_{m-1,j^c}/\tilde P_{m-2,(j^c,j^c)}$.
		\item Let $m\geq 3$ and $1\leq r\leq m-1$ and let $\mathbf j:=(\underline{j_1},\ldots,\underline{j_r})$ be an admissible sequence. Let ${\bf j}(k):=(\underline{j_1},\ldots,\underline{j_k})$ for $k=2,\ldots,r-1$. Then we recursively have
		\[\tilde P_{m-l,(j_1^c,\ldots,j_k^c)}^{\delta^k{\bf j(k)}}=\tilde P_{m-l+1,(j_1^c,\ldots,j_{k-1}^c)}^{\delta^{k-1}\bf j(k)}\]
		for $k=1,\ldots,r$. Thus we can associate a unique truncated preprojective representation $$\tilde P^{\mathbf j}_{m-r+1}:=\tilde P_{m-r+1,(j_1^c,\ldots,j_{r-1}^c)}^{(j_{r-1}^c,j_{r,1},\ldots,j_{r,s})}$$%/\tilde P_{m-r+1,(j_1^c,\ldots,j_{r-1}^c)}$$ 
		with each admissible sequence ${\bf j}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The first statement follows from Theorem \ref{covering}. For $m=1$, the second part is obvious. For $m\geq 2$, it then follows by applying the identities (\ref{recursive}).

To prove the third part, we consider the following commutative diagram where the square on the left hand side is the corresponding Auslander-Reiten sequence:
\[\xymatrix{0\ar[r] &\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n-1}\tilde P_{m-1,j_i}\ar[r] &  \tilde P_{m}\ar[r] & \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}\ar[r] & 0 \\
  0\ar[r]&\tau\tilde P_m=\tilde P_{m-2} \ar[r]\ar[u] & \tilde P_{m-1,j^c}\ar[u]\ar[r]& \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}\ar[r]\ar@{=}[u]& 0}\]

%Thus we see that $\tilde P_{m}^{\ui}\cong \tilde P_{m-1}^{(l)}$ for some $l\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$. But now it is straightforward to check that $l=n$. \footnote{more precise?} 
For $m=3$, is straightforward that the injection of the lower row factors over $\tilde P_{1,j^c}$ which means that we get the same commutative diagram when replacing $\tilde P_{1}$ by $\tilde P_{1,(j^c,j^c)}$. Thus we have $\tilde P_{3}^{\ui}\cong \tilde P_{2,j^c}^{\uj^c}$. Applying the identities (\ref{recursive}) the claim follows for $m\geq 3$.

The forth statement is now obtained recursively when initially considering the commutative diagram from above replacing $\uj$ by $\underline{j_1}$. We have $\delta^{k-1}{\bf j}(k)=(j_{k-1}^c,j_{k,1},\ldots,j_{k,n-1})$. We use the third statement in order to successively obtain commutative diagrams
\[\xymatrix{0\ar[r] &\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n-2}\tilde P_{m-k,(j_1^c,\ldots,j_{k-1}^c,j_{k,i})}\ar[r] &  \tilde P^{(j_{k-1}^c)}_{m-k+1,(j_1^c,\ldots,j_{k-1}^c)}\ar[r] & \tilde P_{m-k+1,(j_1^c,\ldots,j_{k-1}^c)}^{\delta^{k-1}{\bf j}(k)}\ar[r] & 0 \\
  0\ar[r]&\tilde P_{m-(k+1),(j_1^c,\ldots,j_{k}^c,j_k^c)} \ar[r]\ar[u] & \tilde P_{m-k,(j_1^c,\ldots,j_{k}^c)}\ar[u]\ar[r]& \tilde P_{m-k,(j_1^c,\ldots,j_{k}^c)}^{(j_{k}^c)}\ar[r]\ar@{=}[u]& 0}\]
Now we have $\delta^{k-1}{\bf j}(k)=(j_k^c)$.	Finally, we consider the short exact sequence:

\[\xymatrix{0\ar[r] &\bigoplus_{i=1}^{s}\tilde P_{m-r,(j_1^c,\ldots,j_{r-1}^c,j_{r,i})}\ar[r] &  \tilde P^{(j_{r-1}^c)}_{m-r+1,(j_1^c,\ldots,j_{r-1}^c)}\ar[r] & \tilde P_{m-r+1,(j_1^c,\ldots,j_{r-1}^c)}^{{\bf j}}\ar[r] & 0 }.\]
As $\Hom(\tilde P_{m-k,(j_1^c,\ldots,j_{k-1}^c,j_{k,i})},\tilde P_{m-k+1,(j_1^c,\ldots,j_{k-1}^c)})=\kk$ for all $k=2,\ldots,r$ and $i=1,\ldots,n-1$, applying the second statement, we obtain that the quotient $\tilde P_{m-r+1}^{\bf j}$ is uniquely determined.
	\end{proof}
We denote the quotient morphism by $\pi_m^{\bf j}:\tilde P_m\to \tilde P_{m-r+1}^{\bf j}$. Let $\ui=(i_{1},\ldots,i_{l})$. It is important for us that this morphism factors through all truncated preprojectives $\tilde P_m^{\ui}$ where $l\leq n-1$ and $i_k\neq j_1^c$ for $k=1,\ldots, l$. We denote the quotient morphism from $\tilde P_m^{\ui}$ to $\tilde P_{m-r+1}^{\bf j}$ by $\pi_{m,\ui}^{\bf j}$. 

Our construction immediately yields the following lemma.
\begin{lemma}\label{projections}
Let $\tilde P_m$ be a lift of the preprojective representation $P_m$ and let ${\bf j}=(\underline{j_1},\ldots,\underline{j_r})$ with $r\leq m-1$ and $\underline{j_r}\in I_s$ be an admissible sequence with entries $j_{k,i}$ for $k=1,\ldots r$. Then we have
\[\pi_m^{\bf j}=\pi_{m-r+1,j_{r-1}^c}^{\underline{j_r}}\circ\ldots\circ\pi^{\underline{j_2}}_{m-1,j_1^c}\circ\pi_m^{\underline{j_1}}\]
and, for any sequence $(l_1,\ldots,l_{n-2})\in I_{n-2}$, we have
\[\pi_{m-k+1,j_{k-1}^c}^{\underline{j_k}}=\prod_{i=1}^{n-2} \pi^{j_{k,l_{i}}}_{m-k+1,(j_{k-1}^c,j_{k,l_1},\ldots,j_{k,l_{i-1}})}\]
for $k=1,\ldots,r-1$ where $\pi_{m,j_{-1}^c}^{\underline{j_1}}:=\pi_m^{\underline{j_1}}$ and the analogous statement for $\pi_{m-r+1,j_{r-1}^c}^{\underline{j_r}}$ and $(l_1,\ldots,l_{s-1})\in I_{s-1}$ holds.
\end{lemma}
We want to apply $\pi_m^{\bf j}$ also to translated representations $w.\tilde P_m$, mostly for $w\in\{a_i,a_i^{-1}\}$. Therefore, we need to apply a translated version of this morphism. In abuse of notation, we also denote this morphism $\pi_m^{\bf j}$.

 We need the following lemma analyzing the possible subrepresentations of truncated preprojective representations.
\begin{lemma}\label{le:subrep}
   All nontrivial proper subrepresentations $U$ of $\tilde P_m^{(i_1,\ldots,i_l)}$ are preprojective.	\footnote{Does it follow that the representations $F_{K(m)}\tilde P_m^{(j_1,\ldots,j_l)}$ are quasi-simple?}

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Without loss of generality, we choose $\{j_1,\ldots,j_l\}=\{1,\ldots,l\}$ and denote $\tilde P_m^{(l)}:=\tilde P_m^{(1,\ldots,l)}$ and define $\tilde P_m^{(0)}=\tilde P_m$ respectively.
We proceed by induction. Clearly $\tilde P_m$ has only preprojective subrepresentations. We can assume without loss of generality that the subrepresentation $U$ is indecomposable. Assume that $U\subsetneq P_m^{(l)}$ is not preprojective. Then the embedding would not factor through $\tilde P_m^{(l-1)}$ by induction hypothesis.  Thus we get a commutative diagram

\[\xymatrix{0\ar[r] &\tilde P_{m-1,l}\ar[r] &  \tilde P_{m}^{(l-1)}\ar[r] & \tilde P_{m}^{(l)}\ar[r] & 0 \\
  0\ar[r]&\tilde P_{m-1,l} \ar[r]\ar[u] & U'\ar[u]\ar[r]& U\ar[r]\ar[u]& 0}\]
where the vertical maps are injective, the sequence on the bottom does not split and the representation $U'$ is preprojective by induction hypothesis. Then we have $U\in\tilde P_{m-1,l}^\perp$
because $$\Hom(\tilde P_{m-1,l},U)=\Hom(\tilde P_{m-1,l},\tilde P_{m}^{(l)})=0.$$ Moreover, $\Ext(\tilde P_{m-1,l},U)=0$ follows because the representation $\tilde P_{m-1,l}$ is preprojective and $U$ is not. We also have $\Hom(U,\tilde P_{m-1,l})=0$ for the same reason. 

As the sequence does not split, this shows that $U'$ is an indecomposable  (reference) preprojective subrepresentation of $\tilde P_{m}^{(l-1)}$. Since the only exceptional representations of $K(n)$ are preprojective, we have $\Sc{\udim U}{\udim U}\leq 0$. Thus, using  $\Sc{\udim U}{\udim \tilde P_{m-1,l})}< 0$, we obtain
\[\Sc{\udim U'}{\udim U'}=\Sc{\udim U}{\udim U}+\Sc{\udim \tilde P_{m-1,l} }{\udim \tilde P_{m-1,l} }+\Sc{\udim U}{\tilde P_{m-1,l}}\leq 1+\Sc{\udim U}{\tilde P_{m-1,l}}\leq 0.\]
But this contradicts the induction hypothesis because preprojective representations do not have self-extensions.

\end{proof}

DO NOT NEED THIS-------FROM HERE----
\begin{lemma}\label{directsums}
  \footnote{This can be proved on the quiver itself.}
  If the quiver Grassmannians $Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m})$ and $Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m-1})$ have cell decompositions into affine spaces, then we have that $Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\bigoplus_{j=1}^s\tilde P^{t_j}_{m-1,i_j}\oplus\bigoplus_{j=1}^k\tilde P^{l_j}_{m,i_j})$ has a cell decomposition into affine spaces where $l_j,t_j\geq 1$ and $s,k\leq n$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}The claim follows by induction when considering the map $$\Psi:Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\bigoplus_{j=1}^k\tilde P^{l_j}_{m,i_j})\to\bigsqcup_{\tbff+\tbfg=\tbfe}  Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(\tilde P_{m,i_1})\times Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P^{l_1-1}_{m,i_1}\oplus\bigoplus_{j=1}^k\tilde P^{l_j}_{m,i_j}),\,U\mapsto (U\cap \tilde P_{m-1,i_1},\pi(U))$$
which is also sometimes called Caldero-Chapoton map.

Indeed, we can use the fact that every subrepresentation $U$ of $\tilde P^{l_1-1}_{m,i_1}\oplus\bigoplus_{j=1}^k\tilde P^{l_j}_{m,i_j}$ is preprojective whence every proper factor $\tilde P_{m,i_1}/V$ is not which means that we have $\Ext(U,\tilde P_{m,i_1}/V)=0$. But since $U$ has only direct summands which are isomorphic to $\tilde P_{m-k}$ for some $k\geq 0$, we also have $\Ext(U,\tilde P_{m-1,i_1})=0$. Thus by the results of \cite[Section 3]{cc} it follows that $\psi^{-1}(U,V)=\mathbb{A}^{\Sc{\udim U}{\udim \tilde P_{m-1,i_1}/V}}$ for all pairs of subrepresentations $(U,V)\in Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(\tilde P_{m,i_1})\times Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P^{l_1-1}_{m,i_1}\oplus\bigoplus_{j=1}^k\tilde P^{l_j}_{m,i_j})$. In particular, the fibres of $\Psi$ are constant over every affine cell $A$ of the right hand side. Thus we can consider the restriction of $\Psi$ to $\Psi^{-1}(A)$. By \cite[Proposition 4]{cj}, it follows that this restriction is a subbundle of a trivial bundle (write this trivial bundle down) and thus it is itself trivial as a vector bundle over an affine space.

In the same manner, we can proceed by inductively adding the summands $\tilde P_{m-1,i}$ in order to see that $Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\bigoplus_{j=1}^s\tilde P^{t_j}_{m-1,i_j}\oplus\bigoplus_{j=1}^k\tilde P^{l_j}_{m,i_j})$ has a cell decomposition.

\begin{lemma}\label{AR}\footnote{special case $m=3$}
 Let $m\geq 4$ and $n-1\geq l\geq 1$, $\uj=(j_1,\ldots,j_l)\in I_l$ and $\uj':=(j_1,\ldots,j_{l-1})$. Consider the short exact sequence $$\sesm{\tilde P_{m-1,j_l}}{\tilde P_{m}^{\uj'}}{\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}}{\pi^{j_l}_{m,\uj'}}$$ and define
$$P(m,\uj):=\bigoplus_{\substack{1\leq i\leq n\\i\neq j_l}}\tilde P_{m-2,(j_l,i)}\oplus \bigoplus_{i=1}^{l-1}\tilde P_{m-3,(j_l,j_l,i)}.$$

 The following holds:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We have $\tau\tilde P_{m}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_l)}=\tilde P_{m-2}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_l)}$.
%\item We have $\tau\tilde P_{m}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_l)}\in ~^\perp(\tilde P_{m}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_l)})$.\footnote{not true for $m\geq 4$. What do we need? We have $\Hom(\tau\tilde P_{m}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_l)},\tilde P_{m}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_l)})=0$}

\end{enumerate}%\footnote{introduce/consider/check indices, we have to mod out the corresponding reps in the covering} 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Using the identities (\ref{recursive}), it suffices to prove the all statements for $m=4$ and arbitrary $1\leq l\leq n-1$. Without loss of generality, we choose $(j_1,\ldots,j_l)=(1,\ldots,l)$ and define $\tilde P_m^{(0)}=\tilde P_m$ respectively. We should point out that it is very important for this prove that we consider fixed lifts of all representations in the universal covering as defined in the beginning of this section. Note that, starting with these cases, we only reflect at sources and no representation appearing is isomorphic to the simple injective representation $S_2$.  


In Example \ref{smallm} it was shown that $\tau \tilde P_4^{(1,\ldots,l)}=\tilde P_2^{(1,\ldots,l)}$. In order to deduce the statement from (\ref{recursive}) for general $m$, it remains to show the statement for $m=5$. Therefore, we may consider the short exact sequence
\[\ses{\bigoplus_{i=1}^l\tilde P_{2,i}}{\tilde P_3}{\tilde P_3^{(1,\ldots,l)}}\]
and apply the reflection functor $\tilde\Sigma_2$ twice which is the same as applying $\tau^{-1}$. As we have $\tau^{-1} \tilde P_{2,i}=\tilde P_{4,i}$ and $\tau^{-1}\tilde P_3=\tilde P_5$, the statement follows for $m=5$ and thus for general $m$.

Considering the quiver $\tilde P_{3,l}$ from above, it is clear that we obtain an exact sequence
$$\ses{P(3,(1,\ldots,l))}{P_{3,l}}{\tilde P_2^{(1,\ldots,l)}}.$$
Actually, the first summand of $P(3,(1,\ldots,l))$ corresponds to the quivers $\tilde A_i$ at the bottom and the second summand to the $l-1$ sources in the second row lying on the left. This shows the second statement.

As $\tilde P_m^{\uj}$ is exceptional on the universal covering by the Auslander-Reiten formulas \cite[Theorem IV.2.13]{ass}, it follows that 
$$\dim\Hom(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tau \tilde P_{m}^{\uj})=\dim\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})=0 \text{ and } \dim\Ext(\tilde P_m^{\uj},\tau\tilde P_m^{j})=\dim\Hom(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})=1.$$
As $\Hom(\tilde P_{4}^{\uj},\tilde P_{3,j_l})=0$ and $\Ext(\tilde P_{4}^{\uj},\tilde P_{3,j_l})=\kk$ by a straightforward check, applying (\ref{recursive}), it follows that $\Hom(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m-1,j_l})=0$ and $\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m-1,j_l})=\kk$. Thus we can consider the long exact sequence obtained when applying $\Hom(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\underline{\quad})$ to the sequence obtained in course of the second statement. This yields the remaining results at once.


%It is also straightforward to check that $\bigoplus_{j\neq l}\tilde P_{2,(l,j)}\oplus \bigoplus_{j=1}^{l-1}\tilde P_{1,(l,l,j)}\in (\tilde P_{4}^{(1,\ldots,l)})^\perp$ and, moreover, that $\Hom(\tilde P_{4}^{(1,\ldots,l)},\tilde P_{3,l})=0$. This yields the third claim when considering the long exact sequence obtained when applying $\Hom(\tilde P_{4}^{(1,\ldots,l)},\underline{\quad})$ to the short exact sequence considered in the second statement.


\end{proof}


Let $\uj=(j_1,\ldots,j_l)$ be an admissible sequence and $m\geq 3$. The short exact sequence $\ses{\tilde P_{m-1,j_l}}{\tilde P_{m}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_{l-1})}}{\tilde P_{m}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_l)}}$ induces a map between quiver Grassmannians
$$\Psi_{m,\uj}:\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_{l-1})})\to\bigsqcup_{\tbff+\tbfg=\tbfe} \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff( \tilde P_{m-1,j_l})\times \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}).$$
Define 
$$P(m,\uj):=\begin{cases}\bigoplus_{\substack{1\leq i\leq n\\i\neq j_l}}\tilde P_{m-2,(j_l,i)}\oplus \bigoplus_{i=1}^{l-1}\tilde P_{m-3,(j_l,j_l,i)}\text{ if }m\geq 4\\\bigoplus_{\substack{1\leq i\leq n\\i\neq j_l}}\tilde P_{1,(j_l,i)}\text{ if }m=3\end{cases}$$

Using Lemma \ref{AR}, for $m\geq 4$, every subrepresentation $U\subset \tilde P_{m,j_l}$ gives rise to a commutative diagram
 
 \[\xymatrix{0\ar[r] &P(m,\uj)\ar[r] &  \tilde P_{m-1,j_l}\ar[r] & \tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}\ar[r] & 0 \\
  0\ar[r]& V\ar[r]\ar[u] & U\ar[u]\ar[r]& W\ar[r]\ar[u]& 0}\]
If $m=3$, we consider the sequence
 \[\xymatrix{0\ar[r] &P(3,\uj)\ar[r] &  \tilde P_{2,j_l}\ar[r] & \bullet\xrightarrow{a_{j_l}}\bullet\ar[r] & 0}\]	
	where the kernel is clearly just a direct sum of simple representations. Recall that the Auslander-Reiten translate of $\tau\tilde P_{3}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_l)}$ is given by
	\begin{align*}\xymatrix@R10pt@C20pt{&&\bullet\ar_{a_{j_1}}[lld]\\\bullet &&\vdots\\&&\bullet\ar_{a_{j_l}}[llu]}\end{align*}
In particular, the image of the unique homomorphism $\tilde P_{2,j_l}\to\tau\tilde P_{3}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_l)}$ has image $\bullet\xrightarrow{a_{j_l}}\bullet$.
In all cases, we denote the corresponding map between quiver Grassmannians by $\Phi_{m,\uj}$. Using this notation, we obtain:
\begin{lemma}\label{quotient}Let $m\geq 3$ and $\uj=(j_1,\ldots,j_l)\in I_l^n$. The following holds:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The fibre $\Psi_{m,\uj}^{-1}(U,\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ is empty if and only if $U\in\Phi_{m,\uj}^{-1}(V,0)$, i.e. $U$ is already a subrepresentation of $P(m,\uj)$.
\item If the fibre $\Psi_{m,\uj}^{-1}(U,\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ is not empty, we have $\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m,j_l}/U)= 0$.
\end{enumerate} 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
In order to prove the case $m=3$, we replace $\tau\tilde P_{3}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_l)}$ by  $\bullet\xrightarrow{a_{j_l}}\bullet$ in which case all arguments hold in the same way.
 
If $W=0$, from Lemma \ref{AR}, i.e. $\Hom(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})=0$, we obtain a commutative diagram

 \[\xymatrix{&0&0&0&\\0\ar[r] &\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},P(m,\uj)/V)\ar[r]\ar[u] &  \Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m-1,j_l}/U)\ar[r]\ar[u] & \Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})\ar[r]\ar[u] & 0 \\
0\ar[r] &\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},P(m,\uj))\ar[r]\ar[u] &  \Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m-1,j_l})\ar[r]\ar[u] & \Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})\ar[r]\ar@{=}[u] & 0\\  0\ar[r] &\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},V)\ar[r]\ar[u] &  \Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},U)\ar[r]\ar[u] &0\ar[r]\ar[u] & 0}\]
	
	
Moreover, the lemma implies that we have $\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},P(m,\uj))=0$ and thus we get $\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},P(m,\uj)/V)=0$. This yields $\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m-1,j_l}/U)\cong\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tau\tilde P_{m,j_l})$ which means that the induced map
\[\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},U)\to\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m-1,j_l})\]
is zero. Therefore, the induced exact sequence splits. On the other hand, every subrepresentation $U\subset \tilde P_{m-1,j_l}$ such that $\Psi_{m,\uj}^{-1}(U,\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ is not empty comes with a commutative diagram
 \[\xymatrix{0\ar[r] &\tilde P_{m-1,j_l}\ar[r] &  \tilde P_{m}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_{l-1})}\ar[r] & \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}\ar[r] & 0 \\
  e_U: 0\ar[r]& U\ar[r]\ar[u] & U'\ar[u]\ar[r]& \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}\ar[r]\ar[u]& 0}\]
which means that the image of $e_U$ in $\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m-1,j_l})$ does not split. Indeed, we have $\Hom(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m}^{(j_1,\ldots,j_{l-1})})=0$ by Lemma \ref{AR}. This yields that the fibre $\Psi_{m,\uj}^{-1}(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},U)$ is empty.


Thus assume that $U\in\Phi_{m,\uj}^{-1}(V,W)$ with $W\neq 0$. We first show that $\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m-1,j_l}/U)= 0$. Clearly, $\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}/W$ is a proper factor of $\tau \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}$ if $W\neq 0$. 
It follows that we have $\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}/W)=0$. Indeed, by Auslander-Reiten theory every non-split morphism $g:\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}\to \tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}/W$ factors through the middle term $Z$ of the AR-sequence 
\[\ses{\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}}{Z}{\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}}\]
which means that the first map of the induced sequence
\[\Hom(\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}/W)\to\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}/W)\to\Ext(Z,\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}/W) \]
is zero. As $\tilde P_m^{\uj}$ is exceptional on the universal covering by the Auslander-Reiten formulas \cite[Theorem IV.2.13]{ass}, it follows that 
$$\dim\Hom(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tau \tilde P_{m}^{\uj})=\dim\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})=0 \text{ and } \dim\Ext(\tilde P_m^{\uj},\tau\tilde P_m^{j})=\dim\Hom(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})=1.$$ Since the map $\kk=\Hom(\tau \tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tau \tilde P_{m}^{\uj})\to\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tau \tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ induced by the Auslander-Reiten sequence is injective and thus bijective, together with $\Ext(\tau \tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tau \tilde P_{m}^{\uj})=0$, this shows $\Ext(Z,\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})=0$ and thus $\Ext(Z,\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}/W)=0$.

%As $\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}$ is exceptional (on the universal cover), we are in the situation of Ringel's reflection \cite{rin} which means that $\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)},\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)})=\kk$, $\Hom(\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)},\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)})=0$ and $\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}\in ~^\perp(\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)})$, i.e. Lemma \ref{AR}, yields $\Ext(Z,\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)})=0$ as the AR-sequence does not split. In conclusion, we obtain $\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)},\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}/W)=0$. 


Again we can apply Lemma \ref{AR} in order to see that $\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},P(m,\uj)/V)=0$ as $\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},P(m,\uj))=0$. 
 Together with $\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^{\uj},\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}/W)=0$, this yields the claim.

Thus it remains to show that $\Psi_{m,\uj}(U,\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ is not empty if $W\neq 0$. Since $\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m-1,j_l}/U)= 0$, we can conclude that the map $\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},U)\to\Ext(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj},\tilde P_{m,j_l})$ is surjective which already means that there exists a commutative diagram as above which, in turn, shows that the fiber is not empty.
\end{proof}
Now we are able to state the following result concerning the fibers of $\Psi_{m,\uj}$:
\begin{proposition}\label{fibers}
 The following hold:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For $V\subsetneq \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}$ and $U\subseteq\tilde P_{m-1,j_l}$, we have $\Psi_{m,\uj}^{-1}(U,V)=\AA^{\langle V,\tilde P_{m-1,j_l}/U\rangle}$.
    \item If $V=\tilde P_{m,\uj}$, the fiber $\Psi_{m,\uj}^{-1}(U,V)$ is not empty if and only if $\Phi_{m,\uj}(U)\neq (U,0)$. In this case, we have $\Psi_{m,\uj}^{-1}(U,V)=\AA^{\langle V,\tilde P_{m-1,l_j}/U\rangle}$.
		
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}By Lemma \ref{le:subrep}.3, any subrepresentation $V\subsetneq \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}$ is preprojective. But the representation $\tilde P_{m-1,l_j}/U$ is not as it is a proper quotient of a preprojective representation unless $U=0$. Thus we have $\Ext(V,\tilde P_{m-1,l_j}/U)=0$. If $U=0$, we have $\Ext(V,\tilde P_{m-1,l_j})=0$ because for dimension reasons every indecomposable direct summand of $V$ is isomorphic to a lift some $P_l$ with $l\leq m$ and, moreover, $\Ext(P_l,P_k)=0$ for $l\leq k+1$.

The second statement follows directly from Lemma \ref{quotient}.

\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}\label{cellscover}
Let $m\geq 2$ and let $\uj=(j_1,\ldots,j_l)\in I_l$ with $l\leq n-1$. Every quiver Grassmannian $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ admits a cell decomposition into affine spaces.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

In order to prove the claim, we prove the more general statement:
\vs

\noindent {\bf Claim.} Let ${\bf j}=(\underline{j_1},\ldots,\underline{j_r})$ with $r\geq 1$ be an arbitrary admissible sequence and $\underline{j_1}=(\uj,j_{1,l+1},\ldots,j_{1,n-1})\in I_{n-1}$. The quiver Grassmannian $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ has a cell decomposition into affine spaces which is compatible with $\pi_{m,\uj}^{\bf j}$  in the following way: 
 Let $U\in\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ such that $\pi_m^{\bf j}(U)\neq 0.$
Then we have $\pi_{m,\uj}^{\bf j}(U')\neq 0$ for all $U'\in C_U$ where $C_U$ is the cell which contains $U$.
\vs


We proceed by induction on $m$ and reverse induction on $l$. Let $\uj'=(j_1,\ldots,j_{l-1})$. If $m=1$ or $m=2$, the statement is straightforward for arbitrary $l$ as all quiver Grassmannians are points.
For general $m$, we consider the short exact sequence $$\sesm{\tilde P_{m-1,j_l}}{\tilde P_{m}^{\uj'}}{\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}}{\pi^{j_l}_{m,\uj'}}$$ induces a map between quiver Grassmannians
$$\Psi_{m,\uj}:\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj'})\to\bigsqcup_{\tbff+\tbfg=\tbfe} \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff( \tilde P_{m-1,j_l})\times \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}).$$
It is important that we can choose $j_l$ arbitrarily with respect to the condition $j_l\neq j_1,\ldots, j_{l-1}$. Moreover, we consider the short exact sequence
$$\sesm{P(m,\uj)}{\tilde P_{m-1,j_l}}{\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}}{\pi^{\bf i}_m}$$
where
$${\bf i}=((1,\ldots,j_l-1,\widehat{j_l},j_l+1,\ldots,n),(j_1,\ldots,j_{l-1}))$$
and $\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj} =\tilde P^{\uj}_{m-2}=\tilde P_{m-2}^{\bf i}$ together with the induced map on quiver Grassmannians $\Phi_{m,\uj}$.

By induction hypothesis the quiver Grassmannians $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff( \tilde P_{m-1,j_l})$ have cell decompositions which are compatible with $\pi^{\bf i}_m$ and, moreover, the quiver Grassmannians $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ have a cell decompositions which are compatible with $\pi^{\bf j}_{m,\uj}$. The second part of Proposition \ref{fibers} says that the fibres are empty if and only if $\pi^{\bf i}_m=0$ and $\tbfg=\udim \tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}$. This yields a collection of cells over which the fibres are empty. Note that $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ is just a point in this case.

If $\tbfg\neq \udim\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}$, the fiber dimension only depends on the dimension vectors $\tbff, \tbfg$ which means that they are constant over the cells of $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(P_{m-1,j_l})\times \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ whose subrepresentations $U\in \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(P_{m-1,i_k})$ which satisfy $\pi_m^{\bf i}(U)\neq 0$, but also over those whose subrepresentations $U\in \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(P_{m-1,i_k})$ satisfy $\pi_m^{\bf i}(U)= 0$. By Theorem \ref{vb}, the claim follows.

Thus it remains to show that there exists a cell decomposition of $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj'})$ which is compatible with a fixed $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{\bf j'}$ where ${\bf j'}=(\underline{j'_1},\underline{j_2},\ldots,\underline{j_r})$ with $\underline{j_1}=(\uj',j_{1,l},\ldots,j_{1,n-1})\in I_{n-1}$ and $j_{1,l}=j_l$. Recall that we have $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{\bf j'}=\pi_{m,\uj}^{\bf j}\circ\pi_{m,\uj'}^{j_l}$ by Lemma \ref{projections}.

Fix $\tbff$ and $\tbfg$ together with cell decompositions 
\[\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(P_{m-1,j_l})=\coprod_{i\in I} B_i,\quad \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})=\coprod_{k\in K} C_k\]
such that the cell decomposition of $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ is compatible with $\pi^{\bf j}_{m,\uj}$. To finish the prove, it suffices to show that the cell decomposition of for $\Gr_{\tbff+\tbfg}(\tilde P_m^{\uj'})$ is compatible with $\pi^{\bf j'}_{m,\uj'}$ because every projection onto a truncated preprojective is of this shape and we did not put (?) any restrictions on ${\bf j'}$. 

We distinguish the following cases
\begin{itemize}
\item $\tbfg =\udim \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}$.
\item $\tbfg \neq \udim \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}$ with cells $B_i$ and $C_k$ such that $\pi^{\bf j}_{m,\uj}(V)=0$ for all $V\in C_k$.
 \item $\tbfg \neq \udim \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}$ with cells $B_i$ and $C_k$ such that $\pi^{\bf j}_{m,\uj}(V)\neq 0$ for all $V\in C_k$.
 
\end{itemize}
In the first case, we have $\Gr_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})=\{\pt\}$ and thus there exists a single cell $C_0=\mathbb{A}^0$. Fix a cell $B_i\subset\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(P_{m-1,j_l})$. As the cell decomposition of $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(P_{m-1,j_l})$ is compatible with $\pi_{m}^{\bf i}$, we either have that the fibre over $B_i\times C_0$ is empty or that the fibre is of constant dimension building a new cell $CB_i$. For all representations $U\in CB_i$ we have $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{\bf j'}(U)\neq 0$ because $\pi_{m,\uj}^{\bf j}$ is surjective and $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{j_l}(U)=\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}$.

In the second case, the fibre over $B_i\times C_k$ is non empty and of constant dimension building a new cell $CB_{i,k}$. As we have $\pi^{\bf j}_{m,\uj}(V)=0$ for all $V\in C_k$, it follows that $\pi^{\bf j'}_{m,\uj'}(U)=0$ for all representations $U\in (CB)_{i,k}$.

In the third case, an analogous argument shows that $\pi^{\bf j'}_{m,\uj'}(U)\neq 0$ for all $U\in (CB)_{i,k}$.

%Thus let $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{\bf j'}(U)= 0$ with $U\subset \tilde P_{m}^{\uj'}$. Then we either have $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{j_l}(U)=0$ which means that $U$ comes from a subrepresentation of $\tilde P_{m,j_l}$ and $\tbfg=0$. In this case, all representations in the cell of $U$ come from a subrepresentation of $\tilde P_{m,j_l}$. Thus assume that $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{j_l}(U)\neq 0$. We have $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{j_l}(U)\neq \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}$ because otherwise we had $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{\bf j'}(U)\neq 0$. Apply induction hypothesis now.


\begin{comment}
We proceed by induction and combine the two maps $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$ and obtain a map
\[\Psi:Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k-1)})\to\bigsqcup_{\tbff+\tbfg+\tbfh=\tbfe} Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff( P(m,k))\times Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)})\times Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfh(\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}).\]

By Lemma \ref{directsums} and induction hypothesis every quiver Grassmannian on the right hand side has a cell decomposition. The second part of the Proposition says that the fibres are empty if and only if $\tbfg=0$ and $\tbfh=\udim \tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}$. In all other cases, the fiber dimension only depend on the dimension vectors $\tbff, \tbfg,\tbfh$ which means that they are constant over $Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff( P(m,k))\times Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)})\times Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfh(\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)})$\footnote{actually this should already say that this is a vector bundle as the base space is smooth (all reps are exceptional), apply Lemma \ref{vb}?}. Analogously to Lemma \ref{directsums}, we can conclude that this induces trivial bundles over every affine cell. In total, this yields a cell decomposition of the quiver Grassmannian $Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k-1)})$.
\end{comment}
\end{proof}


%Note that we can also consider 
%$\Psi_1:Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P^{(k-1)}_{m})\to\bigsqcup_{\tbff+\tbfg=\tbfe} Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(\bigoplus_{i=1}^{k}\tilde P_{m-1,i})\times Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_m^{(k)})$ where $\tilde P_m^{(n-1)}=\tilde P_{m-1}^{(1)}$ (up to renumbering the arrows). But then one needs to adjust $\Psi_2$ because the factor of $\bigoplus_{i=1}^{k}\tilde P_{m-1,i}$ were $(\tau\tilde P_m^{(k)})^k$.


\begin{theorem}\label{celldec}
  Every quiver Grassmannian of a preprojective or preinjective representation of $K(n)$ and $\widetilde{K(n)}$ has a cell decomposition.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
This follows by combining the results of Section 2 and Proposition \ref{fibers}.
\end{proof}

As the $F$-polynomial of truncated preprojective representations only depend on the dimension vector, we may denote them by $F_{\udim P_m{(k)}}$. The description of the non-empty fibres in Proposition \ref{fibers} together with Corollary \ref{fpoly} and Theorem \ref{celldec} yield the following:
\begin{corollary}
For $m\geq 2$ and $0\leq k\leq n-2$, we have 
$$F_{\udim P_m^{(k)}}=F_{\udim P_m^{(k+1)}}F_{\udim P_{m-1}}-x^{\udim P_{m}^{(k)}}F_{\udim P_{m-2}^{(k)}}.$$
\end{corollary}

\section{Combinatorial description of non-empty cells}
                                   
\begin{definition}\begin{enumerate}
\item A $2$-quiver is a triple $Q=(Q_0,Q_1,Q_2)$ consisting of a set of vertices $Q_0$, a set of (usual) arrows $Q_1$ and a set of $2$-arrows which are arrows between full subquivers of the quiver $(Q_0,Q_1)$.

\item We call a subset $\beta\subset Q_0$ successor closed if for every arrow $v:p\to q$ we have: if $p\in \beta$, then $q\in\beta$.

\item We call a subset $\beta\subset Q_0$ strong successor closed if it is successor closed and, moreover, for every $2$-arrow $V:\Gamma(1)\to\Gamma(2)$, we have: if $\Gamma(1)_0\subset \beta$, then there exists a vertex $q\in\Gamma(2)_0$ such that $q\in\beta$.

\item Notion of equivalence of $2$-quivers to justify the transformation of $2$-arrows into usual arrows.

\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The aim is to associate a $2$-quiver with every preprojective representation $P_m$ and with their quotients $P_m^{(k)}$ defined in section \ref{QG}. These $2$-quivers are related to certain coefficient quivers of these representations. The upshot is that the non-empty cells of $\Gr_e(P_m)$ and $\Gr_e(P_m^{(k)})$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the strong successor closed subsets $\beta$ of type $e$. Hence the corresponding Euler characteristic can be computed when counting these subsets. It will turn out that a feature of this description is that it does not take care of the colouring of the different arrows induced by the arrows of $K(n)$.

\begin{remark}\footnote{Insert a remark that we do not work on the universal cover} 
Lemma \ref{AR} can be generalized to the cases $m\leq 2$. The only technical problem is that $\tau \tilde P^{(k)}_{m+1}$ is no quotient of $\tilde P_{m,k}$ and we have to replace it by the image of the unique morphism to $\tau \tilde P^{(k)}_{m+1}$ which induces the exact sequence. 


\end{remark}

We recall the notion of Section \ref{QG} where we denote the arrows of $K(n)$ by $v_1,\ldots,v_n$. Actually, all $2$-quivers can be build from the $2$-quivers of $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_2^{(n-1)}$ where $P_2^{(n-1)}$ depends on a choice as it is a truncated preprojective representation of dimension $(1,1)$.  Indeed, it is the cokernel of a short exact sequence
\[\ses{ P_1^{n-1}}{ P_2}{P_2^{(n-1)}}\]
for which we have $n-1$ choices. Without loss of generality, we make the following choice when defining
$$P_2^{(n-1)}=j^{(n-1)}_2\xlongleftarrow{v_1}i^{(n-1)}_2=P_1^{(1)}=j^{(1)}_1\xlongleftarrow{v_1}i^{(1)}_1$$
by its coefficient quiver. Denoting by $j_1$ the single vertex of the coefficient quiver of $P_1$, we have 
$$\Ext(P_2^{(n-1)},P_1)=\langle i^{(n-1)}_{2}\xrightarrow{v_l}j_1\mid l=2,\ldots,n\rangle.$$


This defines recursively the representation $P_{2}^{(k)}$ for $k=n-1,\ldots,0$ with $P_2^{(0)}=P_2$ when considering the short exact sequences
\[\ses{P_1}{P_2^{(k)}}{P_2^{(k+1)}}\]
by the coefficient quivers
\begin{align}\label{coeff}\xymatrix@R10pt@C20pt{&&j^{(k)}_{2,1}\\ i^{(k)}_2\ar^{v_1}[rru]\ar^{v_{n-k}}[rrd] &&\vdots\\&&j^{(k)}_{2,n-k}}.\end{align}
Note that we have a short exact sequence
\[\ses{\Hom(P_1,P_1)}{\Ext(P_2^{(k)},P_1)}{\Ext(P_2^{(k+1)},P_1)}\]
where a basis of $\Ext(P_2^{(k)},P_1)$ consists of the last $k$ basis elements of the basis of $\Ext(P_2^{(n-1)},P_1)$.
We define the $2$-quiver of $P_2^{(k)}$ by
\\

where the $2$-arrows are coloured red. As the number of strong successor closed subsets of this $2$-quiver coincides with the number of successor closed subsets of the coefficient quiver, for clearness reasons, we will mostly work with the coefficient quiver instead.

The next step is to define the $2$-quivers of $P^{(k)}_3$ whence the remaining $2$-quivers can be obtained recursively. First we choose the basis of $\Ext(P_2^{(1)},P_2)$ given by the linear maps
$$\{i_2^{(n-1)}\xlongrightarrow{v_n}j_{2,i}\mid i=n-1,\ldots,1\}.$$
This basis gives rise to the following $2$-quiver of $P_3^{(k)}$ where we drop the indices of the vertices in abuse of notation.

We have $\dim \Hom(P_m,\tau P_m^{(k)})=\dim\Ext(P_m^{(k)},P_m)=n-k$. If a basis of $\Ext(P_m^{(k)},P_m)$ is compatible with a lift to the universal covering, Lemma \ref{AR} gives a one-to-one correspondence between basis elements of $\Ext(P_m^{(k)},P_m)$ and $\Hom(P_{m-1},\tau P_m^{(k)})$. Let us consider the case $m=3$. The coefficient quiver of $\tau P_3^{(k)}$ is given by
\[\xymatrix@R10pt@C20pt{&&i_{1}\ar_{v_1}[lld]\\ j &&\vdots\\&&i_{k}\ar_{v_{k}}[llu]}.\]
The image of the homomorphism of the corresponding exact sequence induced by the basis element $i_2^{(n-1)}\xrightarrow{v_n} j_{2,l}$ is the quotient quiver $j\xlongleftarrow{v_l} i_l$. Thus in this case the $2$-arrow connects the $2$-quiver of $P_3^{(k)}$ to the image of the corresponding homomorphism $P_2\to P_1^{(k)}$ which is of dimension $(1,1)$. In the above illustration, we forgo to insert the corresponding rectangles and just connected the $2$-arrows to the sinks of the corresponding subquivers. It can be seen that this is no restriction from the combinatorial point of view. 

Now we can recursively the $2$-quivers of $P_m^{(k)}$ for $m\geq 4$ and $k=n-1,\ldots,0$ when repeating this procedure. For $m\geq 4$, the truncated preprojective $\tau P_m^{(k)}$ can uniquely be found as a quotient of $P_m$.
Recall that we have $\udim P_m^{(k)}=\udim P_{m-1}^{(1)}+(n-k-1)\udim P_{m-1}$. Moreover, we have 
\[\dim \Hom(P_{m-1},\tau P_m^{(1)})=\dim\Ext(P_m^{(1)},P_{m-1})=n-1.\]

As before we get a one-to-one correspondence between basis elements when passing to the universal covering quiver. More precisely, we can take the BGP-reflected basis of the basis of $\Ext(P_2^{(1)},P_2)$ from above.

Let us assume that we already constructed the $2$-quiver of $P_{m+1}^{(k)}$. The $2$-quiver of $P^{(k-1)}_{m+1}$ is given by glueing the $2$-quiver of $P_{m+1}^{(k)}$ to the one of $P_{m}$

\begin{theorem}
The Euler characteristic $\chi(\Gr_e(P_m^{(k)}))$ is given by the number of strong successor closed subsets of type $e$ of the $2$-quiver of $P_m^{(k)}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We proceed by induction. The strong successor closed subsets of the $2$-quivers of $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_2^{(n-1)}$ coincide with the successor closed subsets of the coefficient quivers (\ref{coeff}) which we denote by $\Gamma_M$ for $M\in\{P_1, P_2,P_2^{(n-1)}\}$. Passing to the universal cover, we have $\Gr_e(\tilde M)\in\{\emptyset,\{\pt\}\}$ such that $\Gr_e(\tilde M)=\{\pt\}$ if and only if $e\subset (\Gamma_M)_0$ is successor closed. As the number cells of $\Gr_e(\tilde M)$ and $\Gr_e(M)$ coincide, the claim follows.

Thus assume that the claim is true for $P_m$ (resp. $\tilde P_{m}$) and $P_{m+1}^{(k)}$ (resp. $\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}$) and consider the short exact sequence
\[\ses{\tilde P_m}{\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k-1)}}{\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}}.\]
Denote the corresponding $2$-quivers by $\Gamma_{P_m}$ and $\Gamma_{P_{m+1}^{(k)}}$ and let $\beta_1\cup\beta_2\subset (\Gamma_{P_m})_0\cup (\Gamma_{P_{m+1}^{(k)}})_0$ be a pair of strong successor closed subsets which gives rise to a pair of non-empty cell by induction hypothesis. Denote by $d(\beta_1+\beta_2)$ the dimension vector corresponding to this subset. By Proposition \ref{fibers} the pair $\beta_1\cup\beta_2$, it does not correspond to a non-empty cell of $\Gr_{d(\beta_1+\beta_2)}(\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)})$ if and only if $\beta_2=(\Gamma_{P_{m+1}^{(k)}})_0$ and $\beta_1\cap(\Gamma_{\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}})_0=\emptyset$. But this is precisely the condition on $\beta_1\cup\beta_2$ to be strong successor closed as $\Gamma_{P_{m+1}^{(k)}}$ is connected to $\Gamma_{\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}}$ by a $2$-arrow.

\end{proof}


\section{Compatible Pairs Label Cells in $Gr^Q_\bfe(P_m)$}
For $m\ge1$, let $D_m$ denote the maximal Dyck path in the lattice rectangle with corner vertices $(0,0)$ and $(u_m,u_{m-1})$.  
More precisely, $D_m$ is the lattice path which begins at $(0,0)$, takes East and North steps to end at $(u_m,u_{m-1})$, and never passes above the main diagonal joining $(0,0)$ and $(u_m,u_{m-1})$.  
It is maximal in the sense that any lattice point lying strictly above $D_m$ also lies above the main diagonal.  

The maximal Dyck paths $D_m$, $m\ge1$, exhibit the following recursive structure.
In what follows we assume $n\ge2$.
\begin{theorem}
  \cite[Corollary 2.4]{rupel}
  \label{th:dyck path recursion}
  For $n\ge2$, the maximal Dyck path $D_m$, $m\ge1$, can be constructed recursively as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $D_1$ consists of a single horizontal edge;
    \item $D_2$ consists of $n$ consecutive horizontal edges followed by a vertical edge;
    \item $D_m$, $m\ge3$, consists of $n-1$ copies of $D_{m-1}$ followed by a copy of $D_{m-1}$ with its first $D_{m-2}$ removed.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

We obtain the following as an immediate consequence.
\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:short hooks}
  Inside $D_m$, $m\ge2$, there are precisely $u_{m-2}$ vertical edges which are immediately preceded by exactly $n-1$ horizontal edges.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  We work by induction on $m\ge2$.
  The cases $m=2,3$ are immediate from Theorem~\ref{th:dyck path recursion} parts (2) and (3).
  For $m\ge4$, part (3) of Theorem~\ref{th:dyck path recursion} shows by induction that there are $(n-1)u_{m-3}+(u_{m-3}-u_{m-4})=u_{m-2}$ vertical edges which are immediately preceded by exactly $n-1$ horizontal edges.
\end{proof}

For $m\ge2$ and $1\le k\le n-1$, write $D_m^{(k)}$ for the maximal Dyck path obtained from $D_m$ by removing the first $k$ copies of $D_{m-1}$.
Extending this notation we also set $D_m^{(0)}:=D_m$.
\begin{remark}
  Note that by Theorem~\ref{th:dyck path recursion}, we have a natural identification of $D_m^{(n-1)}$, $m\ge3$, with $D_{m-1}^{(1)}$.
\end{remark}
For fixed $m\ge2$ and $1\le r\le n-1$, we write $D_{m-1,r}$ for the $r$-th copy of $D_{m-1}$ inside $D_m$.
For notational convenience we also set $D_{m-1,n}:=D_m^{(n-1)}$ even though this maximal Dyck path does not identify with a copy of $D_{m-1}$.
For $m\ge2$ and $1\le k\le n-1$, the maximal Dyck paths $D_{m-1,r}$, $k+1\le r\le n$, naturally identify with subpaths of $D_m^{(k)}$.

We identify the edges of $D_m$ with the ordered set $E_m=\{1,\ldots,u_m+u_{m-1}\}$, where edges of $D_m$ are taken in the natural order beginning from $(0,0)$.
Let $E_m=H_m\sqcup V_m$, where $H_m=\{h_1,\ldots,h_{u_m}\}$ and $V_m=\{v_1,\ldots,v_{u_{m-1}}\}$ denote the horizontal and vertical edges of $D_m$ respectively.
Following Theorem~\ref{th:dyck path recursion}, we partition the edges as $E_m=\bigsqcup_{r=1}^n E_{m-1,r}$, where $E_{m-1,r}$ denotes the edges of $D_{m-1,r}$.
The set $E_{m-1,r}$ is naturally partitioned into its subsets $H_{m-1,r}$ and $V_{m-1,r}$ of horizontal and vertical edges.

Given edges $e,e'\in E_m$ with $e<e'$, write $ee'$ for the shortest subpath of $D_m$ containing $e$ and $e'$, in particular $ee$ is the subpath containing the single edge $e$.
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:compatibility}
  A pair of subsets $S_H\subset H_m$ and $S_V\subset V_m$ is called \emph{compatible} if: 
  for each pair $(h,v)\in S_H\times S_V$ with $h<v$ there exists an edge $e\in hv$ so that at least one of the following holds
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:hgc}
    e\ne v\qquad\text{and}\qquad |he\cap V_m|=n|he\cap S_H|
  \end{equation}
  or
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:vgc}
    e\ne h\qquad\text{and}\qquad |ev\cap H_m|=n|ev\cap S_V|.
  \end{equation}
  Write $\cC_m$ for the collection of all pairs $(S_H,S_V)$ which are compatible as above.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  This notion of compatibility extends naturally to the maximal Dyck paths $D_m^{(k)}$, $1\le k\le n-1$.  Write $\cC_m^{(k)}$ for the set of all compatible pairs in $D_m^{(k)}$.
\end{remark}

The recursive structure of the maximal Dyck paths from Theorem~\ref{th:dyck path recursion} gives rise to a recursive characterization of compatible pairs.
\begin{definition}

  \label{def:piecewise compatibility}
  A pair of subsets $S_H\subset H_m$ and $S_V\subset V_m$ is called \emph{piecewise compatible} if, for each $1\le r\le n$, one of the conditions \eqref{eq:hgc} or \eqref{eq:vgc} is satisfied for each pair $(h,v)\in S_H\times S_V$ with $h\in H_{m-1,r}$ and $v\in V_{m-1,r}$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  The notion of piecewise compatibility naturally extends to the maximal Dyck paths $D_m^{(k)}$, $1\le k\le n-1$.
\end{remark}

To describe precisely when a piecewise compatible pair $(S_H,S_V)$ is compatible we need more notation.
For a horizontal edge $h\in H_m$ and a subset $S_H\subset H_m$, write $D(h;S_H)=he$ for the shortest subpath of $D_m$ for which $|he\cap V_m|=n|he\cap S_H|$, if no such subpath exists we set $D(h;S_H)=hv_{u_{m-1}}$.
The subpath $D(h;S_H)$ is called the \emph{local shadow path} of $h$ with respect to $S_H$.
Similarly, for a vertical edge $v\in V_m$ and a subset $S_V\subset V_m$, the \emph{local shadow path} of $v$ with repect to $S_V$ is $D(v;S_V)=ev$ for the shortest subpath of $D_m$ for which $|ev\cap H_m|=n|ev\cap S_V|$ and we take $D(v;S_V)=h_1v$ if there does not exist such an edge $e$.
\begin{definition}
  \cite[Definition 3.17]{rupel}
  A horizontal edge $h_i\in H_m$, $m\ge3$, is called \emph{blocking} for a subset $S_H\subset H_m$ if $D(h_i;S_H)=h_iv_{u_{m-1}}$ and $h_i$ is furthest to the right with this property, i.e.\ the index $i$ is maximal with this property. 

  Suppose $S_H\subset H_m$ admits a blocking edge $h_i\in H_m$.
  Then $S_H$ is \emph{left-justified at $h_i$} if there exists $k\ge i$ so that $S_H=\{h_i,h_{i+1},\ldots,h_k\}$.
  The subset $S_H$ is \emph{strongly left-justified at $h_i$} if $S_H$ is left-justified at $h_i$ and $|h_iv_{u_{m-1}}\cap V_m|=n|h_iv_{u_{m-1}}\cap S_H|$.

  A subset $S_V\subset V_m$ is \emph{right-justified with respect to $h_i$} if there exists a vertical edge $v_s\in h_iv_{u_{m-1}}$ so that $S_V\cap h_iv_{u_{m-1}}=\{v_s,v_{s-1},\ldots,v_{u_{m-1}}\}$.
  The subset $S_V$ is \emph{strongly right-justified with respect to $h_i$} if $S_V$ is right-justified with respect to $h_i$ and $D(v_{u_{m-1}};S_V)=h_iv_{u_{m-1}}$ with $|h_iv_{u_{m-1}}\cap H_m|=n|h_iv_{u_{m-1}}\cap S_V|$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  \cite[Theorem 3.20 and Corollary 3.22]{rupel}
  \label{th:blocking edge conditions}
  For $m\ge3$, suppose $S_H\subset H_m$ and $S_V\subset V_m$ are piecewise compatible. 
  Then the following hold:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $S_H$ does not admit a blocking edge, then $(S_H,S_V)\in\cC_m$.
    \item Suppose $S_H$ admits a blocking edge $h_i\in H_m$ and $(S_H,S_V)$ is not compatible.
      Then $S_H$ is left-justified at $h_i$ and $S_V$ is strongly right-justified with respect to $h_i$.
      In addition the following hold:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $m=3$, then $S_H\cap h_iv_{u_{m-1}}=\{h_i\}$.
        \item If $m\ge4$, then $S_H$ is strongly left-justified at $h_i$.
        \item If $m\ge5$, then either $i=1$ or $h_i$ is immediately preceded by a vertical edge in $D_m$.
      \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
  For $m\ge4$ and $0\le k\le n-1$, consider $S_H\subset H_m^{(k)}$ and $S_V\subset V_m^{(k)}$ so that $(S_H,S_V)$ is piecewise compatible.
  Assume $\big(S_H^{(k+1)},S_V^{(k+1)}\big)\in\cC_m^{(k+1)}$.
  Then $(S_H,S_V)$ is not compatible if and only if $H_{m-2}^{(k+1)}\subset S_{H,k+1}$ and $V_m^{(k+1)}\subset S_V$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  We begin with the reverse implication.
  First note that there are $(n-k)u_{m-1}-u_{m-2}$ horizontal edges and $(n-k)u_{m-2}-u_{m-3}$ vertical edges in $D_m^{(k)}$. 
  It follows that $V_{m-2}^{(k+1)}\sqcup V_m^{(k+1)}$ contains $n(n-k)u_{m-3}-nu_{m-4}$ vertical edges and $H_{m-2}^{(k+1)}\sqcup H_m^{(k+1)}$ contains $n(n-k)u_{m-2}-nu_{m-3}$ horizontal edges.

  Assuming $H_{m-2}^{(k+1)}\subset S_{H,k+1}$ and $S_V^{(k+1)}=V_m^{(k+1)}$, we have $S_V\cap V_{m-2}^{(k+1)}=\varnothing$ and $S_H\cap H_m^{(k+1)}=\varnothing$ by piecewise compatibility.
  Let $h\in H_m^{(k)}$ be the horizontal edge corresponding to the first horizontal edge of $H_{m-2}^{(k+1)}$.
  Then, since there are $(n-k)u_{m-3}-u_{m-4}$ horizontal edges in $H_{m-2}^{(k+1)}$, the local shadow path $D(h;S_H)$ contains $n\big((n-k)u_{m-3}-u_{m-4}\big)$ vertical edges and is thus equal to $hv_{u_{m-1}}$.
  Similarly, the local shadow path $D(v_{u_{m-1}};S_V)$ is also equal to $hv_{u_{m-1}}$.
  In particular, neither of the compatibility conditions of Definition~\ref{def:compatibility} are satisfied for the path $hv_{u_{m-1}}$ and so $(S_H,S_V)$ is not compatible.

  For the forward implication, we work by induction on $m\ge4$.
  Consider a pair $(S_H,S_V)$ for $D_4^{(k)}$ as above which is not compatible.
  Following Theorem~\ref{th:blocking edge conditions}, write $h\in H_4^{(k)}$ for the blocking edge of $S_H$.
  Then the number of vertical edges in the local shadow path $D(h;S_H)=hv_{u_3}$ must be divisible by $n$. 
  Since $(S_H^{(k+1)},S_V^{(k+1)})$ is compatible, we must have $h\in H_{3,k}$.
  But observe that $|V_m^{(k)}|=(n-k)n-1$ and so the divisibility condition above implies $h\in H_{3,k}^{(n-1)}$.
  But $S_V$ is strongly right-justified with respect to $h$ and thus the number of horizontal edges in $D(v_{u_3};S_V)=hv_{u_3}$ is divisible by $n$.
  Identifying $H_{3,k}^{(n-1)}$ with $H_2^{(1)}$, this divisibility condition only occurs when $h$ is the first horizontal edge in $H_2^{(k+1)}\subset H_2^{(1)}$.
  Then by piecewise compatibility, the vertical edge of $H_2^{(1)}$ cannot be an element of $S_V$ and we must have $V_4^{(k+1)}\subset S_V$.
  By piecewise compatibility again, this implies $H_4^{(k+1)}\cap S_H=\varnothing$ and so $D(h;S_H)=hv_{u_3}$ implies $H_2^{(k+1)}\subset S_H$.

  To continue, let $(S_H,S_V)$ be a pair for $D_m$, $m\ge5$, which is not compatible.
  Write $\varphi:H_{m-1}\to V_m$ for the bijection given by $\varphi(h_i)=v_i$ for $1\le i\le u_{m-1}$.
  For any subset $T\subset H_{m-1}$, set $\varphi^*(T)=V_m\setminus\varphi(T)$.
  Clearly, the map $\varphi^*$ gives a bijection between subsets of $H_{m-1}$ and subsets of $V_m$.
  In Section 3.2 of \cite{rupel}, a new pair of subsets $\big((\varphi^*)^{-1}S_V,\Omega^{-1}S_H\big)$ for $D_{m-1}$ is given, we refer the reder to \emph{loc. cit} for notation.
  By \cite[Proposition 3.10]{rupel}, the pair $\big((\varphi^*)^{-1}S_V,\Omega^{-1}S_H\big)$ is not compatible, but is piecewise compatible by \cite[proposition 3.16]{rupel}.
  Thus by induction, we must have $H_{m-3}^{(k+1)}\subset(\varphi^*)^{-1}S_V$ and $V_{m-1}^{(k+1)}\subset\Omega^{-1}S_H$.
  It follows from piecewise compatibility that $H_{m-1}^{(k+1)}\cap(\varphi^*)^{-1}S_V=\varnothing$.
  But then by the definition of $\varphi^*$ we have $V_{m-2}^{(k+1)}\cap S_V=\varnothing$ and $S_V^{(k+1)}=V_m^{(k+1)}$ so that $D(v_{u_{m-1}};S_V)=hv_{u_{m-1}}$ with $h$ as in the first case above.
  Since $(S_H,S_V)$ is not compatible, Theorem~\ref{th:blocking edge conditions} states that $h$ must be the blocking edge for $S_H$ and we must have $D(h;S_H)=hv_{u_{m-1}}$.
  But this can only occur if $H_{m-2}^{(k+1)}\subset S_H$ since $H_m^{(k+1)}\cap S_H=\varnothing$ by piecewise compatibility.
\end{proof}


The following result is an immediate consequence of the combinatorial construction of rank 2 cluster variables \cite{lee-li-zelevinsky} and the categorification of these variables using representations of $K(n)$ \cite{cc,caldero-keller}.
\begin{theorem}\cite{lee-li-zelevinsky}
  For each $m\ge1$ and $\bfe\in\ZZ_{\ge0}^2$, we have $\chi\big(Gr_\bfe(P_m)\big)=\big|\{(S_H,S_V)\in\cC_m:|S_H|=u_m-e_1,|S_V|=e_2\}\big|$.
\end{theorem}

Our goal is to show that the compatible pairs provide a natural labeling for the cells of $\chi\big(Gr^Q_\bfe(P_m)\big)$ found in Theorem~\ref{???}.
