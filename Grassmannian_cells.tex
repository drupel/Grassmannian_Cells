\begin{abstract}
  We prove that all quiver Grassmannians for preprojective representations of a generalized Kronecker quiver admit a cell decomposition into affine spaces.  
  In the process, we introduce a class of regular representations which arise as quotients of consecutive preprojective representations.
  Cell decompositions for quiver Grassmannians of these ``truncated preprojectives'' are also established. 
  We also provide two natural combinatorial labelings for these cells.
  On the one hand, the cells are in bijection with compatible pairs in a maximal Dyck path as predicted by the theory of cluster algebras.
  On the other hand, they are labeled by certain subsets of a so-called $2$-quiver attached to a preprojective representation.
  As there is a natural bijection between these two labelings this gives also a geometric explanation for the appearance of Dyck path combinatorics in the theory of quiver Grassmannians.

\section{Introduction}
\noindent A quiver Grassmannian is a projective variety attached to a fixed quiver representation which parametrizes subrepresentations of a fixed dimension.
In recent years, interest in quiver Grassmannians has grown considerably.
On the one hand, this is due to the fact that generating functions for the Euler characteristics of quiver Grassmannians of exceptional representations can be found as cluster variables \cite{ck}.
On the other hand, they are clearly interesting on their own as they reveal many properties of the representation and its geometry.

Although it follows from the results of Hille, Huisgen-Zimmermann and Reineke that every projective variety can be realized as a quiver Grassmannian, 
%-- which is maybe not surprising as the classification problem of indecomposable quiver representations is wild -- 
it turns out that very interesting phenomena arise when restricting to certain quivers or representations with certain properties.
For instance, quiver Grassmannians attached to exceptional representations are smooth \cite{cr}.
For tame quivers of types $\tilde A$ or $\tilde D$, it is known that every quiver Grassmannian attached to an indecomposable representation admits a cell decomposition into affine spaces, see \cite{ce,lw} and references therein.
It has been conjectured\sayD{reference?} that this is also true for exceptional representations of any quiver, in particular for preprojective and preinjective representations. 

There are basically two possible ways to find cell decompositions of quiver Grassmannians if they exist.
One is to find a non-trivial torus action on the quiver Grassmannian under consideration.
If the quiver Grassmannian is smooth, one can apply a result of Bia\l{}ynicki-Birula \cite{bb} which shows that the quiver Grassmannian decomposes into affine bundles over the fixed point components.
In particular, this shows that the quiver Grassmannian has a cell decomposition if the fixed point components have such a decomposition.

Another method uses short exact sequences of quiver representations to induce maps between quiver Grassmannians.
More precisely, the quiver Grassmannian of the middle term maps to the product of the quiver Grassmannians for the two outer terms via the ``Caldero-Chapoton map'' which first appeared in \cite{cc}. 
If the short exact sequence has certain properties -- e.g. (almost) split sequences and certain generalizations -- then cell decompositions of quiver Grassmannians attached to the outer terms transfer to a decomposition of the quiver Grassmannians of the middle term.

In this paper, we combine these two methods in order to show that every quiver Grassmannian attached to an exceptional representation of a generalized Kronecker quiver admits a cell decomposition into affine spaces.
The proof also shows that this is true for so-called truncated preprojective representations which appear as certain quotients of preprojective representations.
It turns out that these are precisely those representations which can be obtained from indecomposable representations of dimension $(d,1)$ when applying reflection functors.
Actually, we can prove that quiver Grassmannians of truncated preprojective representations only depend on the dimension vector of the representation itself and on the fixed dimension vector of the subrepresentations.

As a first step, we show that a torus action with proper fixed point set can be defined on any quiver Grassmannian attached to liftable representations of any acyclic quiver containing parallel arrows or non-oriented cycles, that is for representations which can be lifted to the universal (abelian) covering quiver.
These are precisely those cases where the universal covering quiver differs from the original quiver.
This lifting property holds in particular for so-called tree modules, a class of representations which includes all exceptional representations.
The fixed point set of this torus action consists precisely of those subrepresentations which can also be lifted to the universal (abelian) covering quiver.
Actually, it turns out that each fixed point component is itself a quiver Grassmannian attached to the lifted representation.

The next step is to investigate conditions under which the fixed point components admit a cell decomposition.
Here the Caldero-Chapoton map comes into play.
In the case of the generalized Kronecker quiver, it turns out that a natural filtration of a fixed preprojective representation by preprojectives of smaller dimension transfers to the universal covering quiver.
These filtration can be successively described by short exact sequences.
The main advantage when passing to the universal covering is that the preprojective subrepresentations of the same dimension become orthogonal, a property which rigidifies the situation in a sense.
In the end, this machinery can be used to recursively build cell decompositions of all quiver Grassmannians of lifted (truncated) preprojective representations.
As all the quiver Grassmannians of the (non-lifted) representation are smooth, this combines with the torus action to give a cell decomposition of these quiver Grassmannians.

As a benefit of this construction, we obtain a graph theoretic description of the non-empty cells.
More precisely, with every (truncated) preprojective representation we can associate a so-called $2$-quiver.
Essentially, such a quiver is obtained from a usual quiver by adding a collection of ``$2$-arrows'' between pairs of subquivers.
Now with every subset of the vertices we can associate a dimension vector.
If this subset is also strong successor closed, a condition which is easily verified in practice, it corresponds to a cell and vice versa.

As mentioned above, the Laurent polynomial expressions for cluster variables have been described using the representation theory of quivers \cite{cc,ck}: the cluster variables are generating functions for Euler characteristics of quiver Grassmannians.
For rank two cluster algebras, the Laurent expressions of cluster variables can also be computed using a certain Dyck path combinatorics \cite{llz}.
The confluence of these results gives rise to a combinatorial construction for the Euler characteristics and counting polynomials of certain quiver Grassmannians.
A consequence of our main result is a geometric explanation for these computations: we provide a one-to-one correspondence between the strong successor closed subsets and compatible pairs for an appropriate Dyck path which leads to a geometric explanation for the appearance of Dyck path combinatorics in the theory of quiver Grassmannians.

\section{Quiver Covering Theory}
\label{sec:covering}
\noindent
We refer to \cite{gab} for an introduction to covering theory.
Let $Q$ be an acyclic quiver with vertices $Q_0$ and arrows $Q_1$ which we denote by $\alpha:s(\alpha)\to t(\alpha)$.
A $\CC$-representation $X$ of $Q$ consists of a collection of $\CC$-vector spaces $X_i$ for $i\in Q_0$ and a collection of $\CC$-linear maps $X_\alpha:X_{s(\alpha)}\to X_{t(\alpha)}$ for $\alpha\in Q_1$.
Given $\CC$-representations $X$ and $Y$ of $Q$, a morphism $f:X\to Y$ is a collection of $\CC$-linear maps $f_i:X_i\to Y_i$ for $i\in Q_0$ satisfying $f_{t(\alpha)}\circ X_\alpha=Y_\alpha\circ f_{s(\alpha)}$ for each $\alpha\in Q_1$.
We write $\rep Q$ for the hereditary abelian category of finite-dimensional $\C$-representations of $Q$ and we assume in the following that all representations are finite-dimensional.

Recall that, given $\CC$-representations $X$ and $Y$ of $Q$, any tuple of linear maps $(g_\alpha:X_{s(\alpha)}\to Y_{t(\alpha)})_{\alpha\in Q_1}$ defines a short exact sequence $\ses{Y}{Z}{X}$ with middle term given by the vector spaces $Z_i=X_i\oplus Y_i$ for $i\in Q_0$ and the linear maps $Z_\alpha=\begin{pmatrix} X_\alpha & 0 \\ g_\alpha & Y_\alpha \end{pmatrix}$ for $\alpha\in Q_1$. 
In general, considering the linear map  
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:maphomext}
  d_{X,Y}:\bigoplus_{i\in Q_0}\Hom_\CC(X_i,Y_i)\to\bigoplus_{\alpha\in Q_1}\Hom_\CC(X_{s(\alpha)},Y_{t(\alpha)}),
  \quad (f_i)_{i\in Q_0}\mapsto(f_{t(\alpha)}\circ X_\alpha-Y_\alpha\circ f_{s(\alpha)})_{\alpha\in Q_1},
\end{align}
we have $\mathrm{ker}(d_{X,Y})=\Hom_Q(X,Y)$ and $\mathrm{coker}(d_{X,Y})=\Ext_Q(X,Y)$. In the following, we write $\Hom$ (resp. $\Ext$) instead of $\Hom_Q$ (resp. $\Ext_Q$). As usual, we call a representation $X$ \emph{rigid} if $\Ext(X,X)=0$ and \emph{exceptional} if it is also indecomposable.

Let $W_Q$ be the free non-abelian group generated by $Q_1$.  
Write $A_Q\cong \ZZ^{Q_1}$ for the free abelian group generated by $Q_1$ and denote by $e_\alpha\in A_Q$ the generator corresponding to $\alpha\in Q_1$. 
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:covering quivers}
  The \emph{universal abelian covering quiver} $\hat Q$ of $Q$ has vertices $\hat Q_0=Q_0\times A_Q$ and arrows $\hat Q_1=Q_1\times A_Q$, where $(\alpha,\chi):\big(s(\alpha),\chi\big)\to\big(t(\alpha),\chi+e_\alpha\big)$ for $\alpha\in Q_1$ and $\chi\in A_Q$.
  Write $F_Q:\rep \hat Q\to\rep Q$ for the natural functor. 

  The \emph{universal covering quiver} $\widetilde Q$ of $Q$ has vertices $\widetilde Q_0=Q_0\times W_Q$ and arrows $\widetilde Q_1=Q_1\times W_Q$, where $(\alpha,w):\big(s(\alpha),w\big)\to\big(t(\alpha),w\alpha\big)$ for $\alpha\in Q_1$ and $w\in W_Q$.
  Write $G_Q:\rep\widetilde Q\to\rep Q$ for the natural functor. 

  We say that a representation $X\in\rep Q$ can be \emph{lifted} to $\hat Q$ (resp. $\widetilde Q$) if there exists a representation $\hat X\in\rep \hat Q$ (resp. $\widetilde X\in\rep \widetilde Q$) such that $F_Q\hat X=X$ (resp. $G_Q \widetilde X=X$).
\end{definition}

Note that in our definition every covering quiver has infinitely many connected components, but each of its connected components is a covering in the sense of \cite{gab}.
As indecomposable representations live on one of these components this distinction will be irrelevant.
Note that the natural surjection $W_Q\onto A_Q$ induces a functor $H_Q:\rep \widetilde Q\to\rep \hat Q$.
In addition, observe that every connected component of the universal covering quiver of the universal abelian covering quiver is isomorphic to a connected component of the universal covering quiver of the original quiver.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:lifts of transjectives}
  Every preprojective and preinjective representation of $Q$ can be lifted to $\hat Q$ and to $\widetilde Q$. Any lift of a preprojective (or preinjective) representation is preprojective (preinjective). 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  This statement is clear for the simple representations $S_i$, $i\in Q_0$.
  Now every preprojective or preinjective representation of $Q$ can be obtained by applying a sequence of BGP-reflections \cite{bgp} to a simple representation $S'_j$ of a quiver $Q'$ whose underlying graph is the same as the one for $Q$.
  Applying a BGP-reflection to a fixed vertex $i$ of $Q$ corresponds to applying BGP-reflections to all vertices $(i,\chi)\in\hat Q_0$, where $\chi$ runs through all $\chi\in A_Q$ (resp. to all $(i,w)\in \tilde Q_0$ with $w\in W_Q$).
  This gives both claims.
\end{proof}

The functor $F_Q$ induces a map $F_Q:\ZZ^{\hat Q_1}\to \ZZ^{Q_1}$.
We say that a dimension vector $\hat \bfe$ of $\hat Q$ is \emph{compatible} with $\bfe$ if $F_Q(\hat\bfe)=\bfe$.
The group $A_Q$ acts on $\hat Q$ via translation, this induces actions of $A_Q$ on $\rep\hat Q$ and on $\ZZ^{\hat Q_1}$.
We say two representation (resp. dimension vectors) are \emph{equivalent} if they can be related by the action of $A_Q$.
The analogous observation can also be made for $\widetilde Q$.
If $X$ is a representation of $\hat Q$ (resp. $\widetilde Q$), we denote by $X_\chi$ (resp. $X_w$) the representation obtained via translation by $\chi\in A_Q$ (resp. $w\in W_Q$).  

As $F_Q$ and $G_Q$ are covering functors when restricting to one connected component, we obtain the following result from \cite{gab}.
\begin{theorem}
  \label{covering}
  The functors $F_Q$ and $G_Q$ preserve indecomposability.
  Moreover, for all representations $\hat X,\hat Y \in\rep(\hat Q)$, we have 
  \[\Hom_Q(F_Q\hat X, F_Q\hat Y)\cong \bigoplus_{\chi\in A_Q}\Hom_{\hat Q}(\hat X_\chi,\hat Y)\cong\bigoplus_{\chi\in A_Q}\Hom_{\hat Q}(\hat X,\hat Y_\chi).\]
  Analogous isomorphisms exist when replacing $\Hom$ by $\Ext$ and/or $\rep \hat Q$ by $\rep\widetilde Q$.
\end{theorem}

\section{Representation Theory of Generalized Kronecker Quivers}
\label{sec:RepK(n)}

\noindent Fix $n\ge3$. Denote by $K(n)$ the \emph{$n$-Kronecker quiver} $1\stackrel{n}{\longleftarrow}2$ with vertices $K_0(n)=\{1,2\}$ and $n$ arrows from vertex $2$ to vertex $1$. 
The category $\rep K(n)$ of finite-dimensional representations of $K(n)$ is equivalent to the category of modules over the path algebra $A(n)$ of $K(n)$.
As a $\CC$-vector space, the path algebra $A(n)$ can be written as $A_0\oplus A_1$, where 
\begin{itemize}
  \item $A_0=\CC e_1\oplus \CC e_2$ is a two-dimensional semisimple algebra with orthogonal idempotents $e_1$ and $e_2$;
  \item $A_1=\bigoplus_{i=1}^n \CC\alpha_i$ is the $A_0$-bimodule spanned by the arrows of $K(n)$, that is $e_k\alpha_ie_\ell=\delta_{k1}\delta_{\ell2}\alpha_i$ for $1\le i\le n$ and $k,\ell\in\{1,2\}$.
\end{itemize}

Write $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ for the BGP-reflection functors of $K(n)$ \cite{bgp}. 
We use the same symbols $\Sigma_1$, $\Sigma_2$ for the BGP-reflection functors of $K(n)^{op}$, this should not lead to any confusion. 
Then each endofunctor $\Sigma_i^2$ is naturally isomorphic to the identity map on the full subcategory $\rep_{\langle i\rangle} K(n)\subset \rep K(n)$ whose objects are those representations of $K(n)$ which do not contain the simple $S_i$ as a direct summand.
In particular, $\Sigma_i$ gives an exact equivalence of categories $\Sigma_i:\rep_{\langle i\rangle} K(n)\to\rep_{\langle i\rangle} K(n)^{op}$.
Also, following \cite{brenner-butler}, the Auslander-Reiten translation $\tau:\rep K(n)\to\rep K(n)$ may be identified with the functor $\Sigma_2\Sigma_1$.

Define Chebyshev polynomials $u_k$ for $k\in\ZZ$ by the recursion $u_0=0$, $u_1=1$, $u_{k+1}=nu_k-u_{k-1}$.
The following is well-known.
\begin{theorem}
  \label{th:rigids}
  For each $m\ge1$, there exist unique (up to isomorphism) exceptional representations $P_m$ and $I_m$ of $K(n)$ with dimension vectors $(u_m,u_{m-1})$ and $(u_{m-1},u_m)$ respectively satisfying $\Hom(P_m,P_r)=0$ (resp. $\Hom(I_r,I_m)=0$) and $\Ext(P_r,P_m)=0$ (resp. $\Ext(I_m,I_r)=0$) for $1\leq r\leq m$.
  Moreover, any rigid representation of $K(n)$ is isomorphic to one of the form $P_m^{a_1}\oplus P_{m+1}^{a_2}$ or $I_m^{a_1}\oplus I_{m+1}^{a_2}$ for some $m\ge1$ and some $a_1,a_2\ge0$.
	
\end{theorem}
The representations $P_m$ are called the \emph{preprojective} representations of $K(n)$ and the representations $I_m$ are called \emph{preinjective}.
\begin{remark}
  \label{rem:reflection recursion}
  We may identify the quiver $K(n)$ with $K(n)^{op}$ by interchanging the vertex labels.
  This induces an isomorphism of categories $\rep K(n)\cong\rep K(n)^{op}$ which we write as $M\mapsto M^\sigma$.
  Note that $\Sigma_1(M^\sigma)=(\Sigma_2 M)^\sigma$ and $\Sigma_2(M^\sigma)=(\Sigma_1 M)^\sigma$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The preprojective and preinjective representations satisfy the following recursions using the reflection functors:
      \[P_1=S_1,\quad P_m^\sigma=\Sigma_2 P_{m-1},\quad I_1=S_2,\quad I_m^\sigma=\Sigma_1 I_{m-1}\]
      for $m\ge2$.
      In particular, we have $P_{m-1}=\tau P_{m+1}$ and $I_{m+1}=\tau I_{m-1}$ for $m\ge2$.
    \item If $\ses{M}{B}{N}$ is a short exact sequence such that no direct summand of $M$, $B$, nor $N$ is preinjective, then the sequences $\ses{(\Sigma_1\Sigma_2)^nM}{(\Sigma_1\Sigma_2)^nB}{(\Sigma_1\Sigma_2)^nN}$ and $\ses{\Sigma_2(\Sigma_1\Sigma_2)^nM}{\Sigma_2(\Sigma_1\Sigma_2)^nB}{\Sigma_2(\Sigma_1\Sigma_2)^nN}$ are exact for any $n\ge0$ and none of these representations contain preinjective direct summands.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

Set $H_m:=\Hom(P_m,P_{m+1})$ for $m\ge1$.
Write $\Gr(H_m)$ for the \emph{total Grassmannian} of $H_m$ whose elements are nontrivial proper subspaces $V\subset H_m$.
Some results below remain true if we allow $H_m$ or $0$ as elements of $\Gr(H_m)$, but not all, so for uniformity of exposition we omit these possibilities.
For $1\le r\le n-1$, let $\Gr_r(H_m)\subset \Gr(H_m)$ be the subvariety of $r$-dimensional subspaces of $H_m$.

For each $m\ge2$, there is an Auslander-Reiten sequence (cf.\ \cite[Section V]{ars})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:AR sequence}
  0\longrightarrow P_{m-1}\stackrel{\iota_{m-1}}{\longrightarrow} P_m\otimes H_m\stackrel{ev}{\longrightarrow} P_{m+1}\longrightarrow 0,
\end{equation}
where the right-hand morphism is the natural evaluation map.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:injective evaluation maps}
  For any $V\in \Gr(H_m)$, $m\geq 1$, the natural evaluation map $ev_V:P_m\otimes V\to P_{m+1}$ is injective.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  As $\Ext(P_m\otimes V,P_{m-1})=0$ and $\Hom(P_1,I_1)=0$, we obtain a commutative diagram 
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & P_{m-1}\ar@{=}[d]\ar[r] &P_{m-1}\oplus P_m\otimes V \ar@{}[dr]|(.7){\lrcorner} \ar[r]\ar[d]_{(\iota_{m-1},\mathrm{id}_{P_m}\otimes \iota_V)} &P_{m}\otimes V \ar[r]\ar_{ev_V}[d] & 0 \ar[d]\\ 0 \ar[r] & P_{m-1}\ar[r]^{\iota_{m-1}} & P_m\otimes H_m \ar[r]^{ev} &P_{m+1} \ar[r] & I_{2-m}\ar[r]&0}\]
  in which we set $P_0=0$ and $I_l=0$ for $l\leq 0$.
  Since $\mathrm{id}_{P_1}\otimes \iota_V$ is injective, the snake lemma shows that $\ker ev_V=0$ for $m=1$ and thus $ev_V$ is injective in this case.
  
  In view of Remark~\ref{rem:reflection recursion}, it is enough for the case $m>1$ to show that the cokernel of $ev_V$ does not have a preinjective direct summand when $m=1$.
  Clearly the cokernel of $\mathrm{id}_{P_1}\otimes \iota_V$ is isomorphic to $P_1\otimes H_1/V$.
  Thus we obtain the following commutative diagram induced by the cokernels of the above vertical maps, note that the vertical maps below are surjective:
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r]  & P_1\otimes H_1 \ar[d]\ar[r]^{ev} &P_{2}\ar[d] \ar[r] & I_{1}\ar@{=}[d]\ar[r]&0\\ 0\ar[r] & P_1\otimes H_1/V \ar[r] &K\ar[r]& I_{1}\ar[r]&0.}\]

  We need to show that $K$ has no preinjective direct summand.
  As $\Hom(P_2,P_1)=0$ and as the vertical maps are surjective, the representation $K$ has no direct summand which is isomorphic to $P_1=S_1$.
  But this already shows that $K$ is indecomposable as $\udim K=(\dim H_1/V,1)$.
  Since $V$ is a proper subspace of $H_1$, $\udim K$ is not the dimension vector of a preinjective representation and the claim follows.
\end{proof}

In what follows we will not distinguish between $P_m\otimes V$ and its image under $ev_V$.



\subsection{Truncated Preprojectives}
\label{sec:truncated preprojectives}
Motivated by Lemma~\ref{le:injective evaluation maps}, we define the following.
\begin{definition}
  For $V\in \Gr(H_m)$, define the \emph{truncated preprojective} $P_{m+1}^V$ to be the cokernel of the map $ev_V:P_m\otimes V\to P_{m+1}$, i.e.\ we have a short exact sequence
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:truncated preprojectives}
    0\longrightarrow P_m\otimes V\stackrel{ev_V}{\longrightarrow} P_{m+1}\stackrel{\pi_V}{\longrightarrow} P_{m+1}^V\longrightarrow 0.
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  It will be convenient to also set $P_{m+1}^0=P_{m+1}$, observe that this notation is consistent with taking $V=0$ in the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives}.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:truncated homomorphisms}
  For $V\in \Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, we have $\Hom(P_m,P_{m+1}^V)\cong H_m/V$ and $\Ext(P_m,P_{m+1}^V)=0$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  As $P_m$ is exceptional, applying the functor $\Hom(P_m,-)$ to the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives}, gives an exact sequence
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & \Hom(P_m,P_m\otimes V) \ar[r] & \Hom(P_m,P_{m+1}) \ar[r] & \Hom(P_m,P_{m+1}^V) \ar[r] & 0}\]
  and an isomorphism
  \[\Ext(P_m,P_{m+1})\cong\Ext(P_m,P_{m+1}^V).\]
  But there is a natural isomorphism $\Hom(P_m,P_m\otimes V)\cong V$ and the first claim follows.
  The final claim follows from Theorem ~\ref{th:rigids} which implies $\Ext(P_m,P_{m+1})=0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:unique preprojective morphism}
  For $V\in \Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, the space $\Hom(P_{m+1},P_{m+1}^V)$ is one-dimensional spanned by the natural projection $\pi_V:P_{m+1}\to P_{m+1}^V$.
  Moreover, $\Ext(P_{m+1},P_{m+1}^V)=0$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 As $\Hom(P_{m+1},P_m)=\Ext(P_{m+1},P_m)=0$, applying the functor $\Hom(P_{m+1},-)$ to the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives}, we obtain isomorphisms 
  \[\Hom(P_{m+1},P_{m+1})\cong\Hom(P_{m+1},P_{m+1}^V)\]
  and 
  \[\Ext(P_{m+1},P_{m+1})\cong\Ext(P_{m+1},P_{m+1}^V).\]
  The identity map on $P_{m+1}$ is taken to the projection $\pi_V:P_{m+1}\to P_{m+1}^V$ under the isomorphism.
  The rigidity of $P_{m+1}$ gives the final claim.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:unique morphisms}
  Consider $V,W\in \Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item There exists a morphism $P_{m+1}^W\to P_{m+1}^V$ if and only if $W\subset V$ and this morphism is unique (up to scalars) when it exists.
    \item For $W\subset V$, we have $\Ext(P_{m+1}^W,P_{m+1}^V)\cong W^*\otimes(H_m/V)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We apply the functor $\Hom(-,P_{m+1}^V)$ to the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives} for $W$ to get an exact sequence
  \[0\longrightarrow \Hom(P_{m+1}^W,P_{m+1}^V)\longrightarrow \Hom(P_{m+1},P_{m+1}^V)\stackrel{-\circ ev_W}{\longrightarrow} \Hom(P_m\otimes W,P_{m+1}^V)\longrightarrow \Ext(P_{m+1}^W,P_{m+1}^V)\longrightarrow 0.\]
  But the space $\Hom(P_{m+1},P_{m+1}^V)$ is one-dimensional and thus $\Hom(P_{m+1}^W,P_{m+1}^V)$ is nonzero if and only if the morphism $-\circ ev_W$ of the above sequence is zero.
  But this occurs exactly when the image of $ev_W:P_m\otimes W\to P_{m+1}$ is contained in the kernel of $\pi_V$, i.e.\ in the image of $ev_V:P_m\otimes V\to P_{m+1}$, and this occurs if and only if $W\subset V$. 
  In this case, there are isomorphisms
  \[\Ext(P_{m+1}^W,P_{m+1}^V)\cong\Hom(P_m\otimes W,P_{m+1}^V)\cong W^*\otimes H_m/V,\]
  where the last isomorphism is immediate from Lemma~\ref{le:truncated homomorphisms}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  The total Grassmannian $\Gr(H_m)$ is naturally a poset under inclusion.
  This structure gives rise to a $\CC$-linear category $\CC \Gr(H_m)$ with objects the elements of $\Gr(H_m)$ and at most one morphism (up to scalars) between any two objects.
  Write $\cP_{m+1}$ for the full subcategory of $\rep K(n)$ with objects the truncated preprojectives $P_{m+1}^V$ for $V\in \Gr(H_m)$.
  By Lemma~\ref{le:unique morphisms}(1), the functor $V\mapsto P_{m+1}^V$ gives an isomorphism of categories $\CC \Gr(H_m)\cong\cP_{m+1}$.
\end{remark}
For the truncated preprojective representations $P_{m+1}^V$, we have  $\udim P_{m+1}^V=d(m,\dim V):=\udim P_{m+1}-\dim V\cdot\udim P_m$. They will play an important role when describing quiver Grassmannians of preprojective representations recursively. For a dimension vector $d=(d_1,d_2)\in\NN^{K(n)_0}$, write $$R_d(K(n))=\bigoplus_{i=1}^n\Hom_{\CC}(\CC^{d_2},\CC^{d_1})$$ for the affine space of representations of dimension $d$. 
\begin{proposition}
  \label{pro:indecomposables}
  Let $m\geq 1$ and $0\le r\le n-1$.
  The following hold:
  \begin{enumerate}
	
    \item The isomorphism classes of indecomposable representations of dimension $d(m,r)$ are in one-to-one correspondence with points of $\Gr_{n-r}(\CC^n)$.
  \item The indecomposable representations of dimension $d(m,r)$ are precisely the truncated preprojective representations $P_{m+1}^V$ for $V\in \Gr(H_m)$. 
	\item The set of indecomposable representations of dimension $d(m,r)$ is given by a non-empty open subset of $R_{d(m,r)}(K(n))$. 

  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  As the reflection functors $\Sigma_1,\,\Sigma_2$ preserve indecomposability and $\Sigma_2(d(m,r))^\sigma=d(m+1,r)$, it suffices to prove the first statement for $m=1$.
  Then we have $d(m,r)=(l,1)$ for $l:=n-r$.
  This means that $X\in R_{d(m,r)}(K(n))$ can be represented by a matrix $M_X\in\CC^{l\times n}$, where the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ column stands for $X_{\alpha_i}$.
  Now $X$ is indecomposable if and only if $\rk(M_X)=l$.
  Indeed, $X$ admits a summand isomorphic to $S_1^k$ exactly when $\rk(M_X)=l-k$.

  This shows that the indecomposable representations in $R_{(l,1)}(K(n))$ are in one-to-one correspondence with $l\times n$ matrices of maximal rank.
  Thus we may associate to each such representation $X$ a subspace of $\CC^n$ of dimension~$l$ spanned by the row vectors of the corresponding matrix $M_X$.
  Now it is straightforward to check that the $\GL_{d(m,r)}=\GL_l(\CC)\times\CC^\ast$-action on $R_{d(m,r)}(K(n))$ corresponds to the base change action of $\GL_l(\CC)$ on the set of these subspaces.
  This shows the first statement.

  By Lemma~\ref{le:unique morphisms}, the endomorphism ring of $P_{m+1}^V$ is one-dimensional and so $P_{m+1}^V$ must be indecomposable.
  Since both the isomorphism classes of indecomposables and the isomorphism classes of truncated projectives of dimension $d(m,r)$ are parametrized by the same Grassmannian, this gives the second claim.

  As there exist representations with trivial endomorphism ring, the dimension vectors $d(m,r)$ are Schur roots.
  It follows that the set of indecomposable representations with trivial endomorphism ring forms a dense open subset of $R_{d(m,r)}(K(n))$, see for example \cite[Theorem 2.2]{sch}.
  This shows the last claim.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
  There is a more elegant way to prove the first part of Proposition~\ref{pro:indecomposables} using the notion of stability and moduli spaces.
  Actually, fixing the standard stability induced by the linear form $\Theta:\ZZ^{Q_0}\to\ZZ$ defined by $\Theta(d)=d_2$, it can be shown that all indecomposables are stable and that the moduli space of stable representations is in fact $\Gr_l(\CC^n)$.
  We opted for the proof above because the notion of stability would only be used at this point and we wanted to keep the exposition as simple as possible. 
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:basic homological properties}
  For $V\in\Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, we have $\Hom(P_{m+1}^V,P_\ell)=0=\Ext(P_\ell,P_{m+1}^V)$ for all $\ell\ge1$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Recall that $\Hom(X,P_\ell)\ne0$ (resp. $\Ext(P_\ell,X)\ne0$) for some indecomposable representation $X$ and some $\ell\ge1$ implies that $X$ is preprojective of the form $P_r$ with $1\le r\le\ell$ (resp. $1\le r\le\ell-2$).
  However, $P_{m+1}^V$ is indecomposable by Proposition~\ref{pro:indecomposables} and it cannot be preprojective as it is not rigid by Lemma~\ref{le:unique morphisms}.
  %Note that $\udim P_{m+1}^V <\udim P_{m+1}$, but $\udim P_r\geq \udim P_{m+1}$ if $\Hom(P_{m+1},P_r)\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:reflected truncated preprojectives}
  For $V\in\Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge2$, the representation $\Sigma_1(P_{m+1}^V)^\sigma$ is also truncated preprojective.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By Proposition~\ref{pro:indecomposables} and Lemma~\ref{le:unique morphisms}, $P_{m+1}^V$ is indecomposable but not rigid.
  In particular, $P_{m+1}^V$ does not have a summand isomorphic to $S_1$.
  Thus, following Remark~\ref{rem:reflection recursion}, we may apply the functor $\Sigma_1(-)^\sigma$ to the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives} to get the exact sequence
  \[0\longrightarrow P_{m-1}\otimes V\xrightarrow{\Sigma_1(ev_V)^\sigma} P_m\longrightarrow \Sigma_1(P_{m+1}^V)^\sigma\longrightarrow 0\]
  which gives the claim.
\end{proof}

For $V\in \Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, any subspace $W\subset V$ gives rise to an exact sequence
\[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & P_m\otimes(V/W) \ar[r]^(.6){ev} & P_{m+1}^W \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0},\]
where the left hand morphism above is the natural evaluation morphism coming from Lemma~\ref{le:truncated homomorphisms}.
Each such sequence has the following almost-split property for proper subrepresentations of $P_{m+1}^V$.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:projective subrepresentations}
  For $V\in \Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, any proper subrepresentation $X\subsetneq P_{m+1}^V$ can be written as a direct sum of preprojective representations $P_r$ with $1\le r\le m$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We proceed by induction on $m$.
  When $m=1$, the dimension vector of $P_{m+1}^V$ is $(\codim_{H_m} V,1)$.
  In particular, it is immediate that each proper subrepresentation of $P_{m+1}^V$ is isomorphic to $P_1^k$ for some $0\le k\le\codim_{H_m} V$.

  For $m\ge2$, we observe by induction that Lemma~\ref{le:reflected truncated preprojectives} implies that any subrepresentation of $P_{m+1}^V$ which has no summand isomorphic to $P_1$ must be a direct sum of preprojective representations $P_r$ with $2\le r\le m$.
  Indeed, each of these is obtained from a subrepresentation of $\Sigma_1(P_{m+1}^V)^\sigma$ by applying the functor $\Sigma_2(-)^\sigma$ and the claim follows from the recursions in Remark~\ref{rem:reflection recursion} for preprojective representations.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  Consider $V,W\in \Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge1$, with $W\subset V$.
  Given any proper subrepresentation $X\subsetneq P_{m+1}^V$ and any subrepresentation $Z\subset P_m\otimes(V/W)$, there is a subrepresentation of $P_{m+1}^W$ isomorphic to $Z\oplus X$ which fits into a commutative diagram
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & Z \ar[d]\ar[r] & Z\oplus X \ar[r]\ar[d] & X \ar[d]\ar[r] & 0 \\
    0 \ar[r] & P_m\otimes(V/W) \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^W \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0}\]
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Observe that $\Ext(P_r,P_m)=0$ for $1\le r\le m$ and, since $X$ is a direct sum of preprojectives $P_r$ with $1\leq r\leq m$, the upper pullback sequence
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & P_m\otimes(V/W) \ar@{=}[d]\ar[r] & Y \ar[r]\ar[d]\ar@{}[dr]|(.7){\lrcorner} & X \ar[d]\ar[r] & 0 \\
    0 \ar[r] & P_m\otimes(V/W) \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^W \ar[r] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0}\]
  must split.
  The claim for arbitrary subrepresentations $Z\subset P_m\otimes(V/W)$ is an immediate consequence of this splitting.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:unique truncated extension}
  For $V\in \Gr(H_m)$, $m\ge2$, the space $\Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_{m-1})$ is one-dimensional and spanned by the extension
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:unique extension}
    \xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & P_{m-1} \ar[r]^(.375){\kappa_V} & P_m\otimes(H_m/V) \ar[r]^(.625){ev} & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0}.
  \end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Applying the functor $\Hom(-,P_{m-1})$ to the sequence \eqref{eq:truncated preprojectives} gives an isomorphism $\Ext(P_{m+1}^V,P_{m-1})\cong\Ext(P_{m+1},P_{m-1})$ with a one-dimensional space.
  Writing $X$ for the unique extension of $P_{m+1}^V$ by $P_{m-1}$, this isomorphism gives rise to the following pullback diagram:
  \[\xymatrix{ & & 0 \ar[d] & 0\ar[d] & \\
    & & P_m\otimes V \ar@{=}[r]\ar[d] & P_m\otimes V\ar[d] & \\
    0 \ar[r] & P_{m-1} \ar@{=}[d]\ar[r]^(.425){\iota_{m-1}} & P_m\otimes H_m \ar[r]\ar[d]\ar@{}[dr]|(.7){\lrcorner} & P_{m+1} \ar[r]\ar[d] & 0\\
    0 \ar[r] & P_{m-1} \ar[r]^{\kappa_V} & X \ar[r]\ar[d] & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r]\ar[d] & 0\\
    & & 0 & 0 & }\]
  from which we immediately obtain the isomorphism $X\cong P_m\otimes(H_m/V)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:preprojective homomorphism duality}
  The sequence \eqref{eq:AR sequence} gives rise to an isomorphism $H_m^*\cong H_{m-1}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Define a map $H_m^*\to H_{m-1}$ by $\varphi\mapsto\bar{\varphi}:=(id\overline{\otimes}\varphi)\circ\iota_{m-1}$, in words $\bar{\varphi}$ acts on $x\in P_{m-1}$ by contracting with the second factor in $\iota_{m-1}(x)$ to give an element of $P_m$.
  Suppose $\varphi\in H_m^*$ is a nonzero functional on $H_m$ and let $V\subsetneq H_m$ denote the kernel of $\varphi$.
  Then $\bar{\varphi}=0\in H_{m-1}$ if and only if the image of $\iota_{m-1}$ is contained in $P_m\otimes V\subsetneq P_m\otimes H_m$.
  But then Lemma~\ref{le:injective evaluation maps} implies $ev\circ\iota_{m-1}=ev_V\circ\iota_{m-1}\ne0$, a contradiction.
  Thus the map $H_m^*\to H_{m-1}$, $\varphi\mapsto\bar{\varphi}$ must be injective and hence an isomorphism.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
  The set $\Gr(H_m)$ is naturally a poset and Lemma~\ref{le:preprojective homomorphism duality} gives an identification of the opposite poset $\Gr(H_m)^{op}\cong \Gr(H_m^*)$ with $\Gr(H_{m-1})$.
  We write $\bar{V}\subset H_{m-1}$ for the subspace corresponding to $V\subset H_m$ under this identification.
  Under the isomorphism of $H_{m-1}$ with $H_m^*$, we have $\bar{V}=(H_m/V)^*$.
\end{remark}

\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:truncated preprojective isomorphism}
  Suppose $V\in \Gr(H_m)$ has codimension-one in $H_m$.  Then $P_{m+1}^V\cong P_m^{\bar{V}}$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  By Lemma~\ref{le:unique truncated extension}, we have the exact sequence
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & P_{m-1} \ar[r]^(.35){\kappa_V} & P_m\otimes(H_m/V) \ar[r]^(.625){ev} & P_{m+1}^V \ar[r] & 0}.\]
  But $H_m/V$ is a one-dimensional vector space and so $P_m\otimes(H_m/V)\cong P_m$.
  Under this identification, the left hand morphism $\kappa_V$ in the sequence above identifies with a generator of $\bar{V}$ and thus $P_{m+1}^V\cong P_m^{\bar{V}}$.
\end{proof}

               


\subsection{Lifting to \texorpdfstring{$\mathbf{\widetilde{K(n)}}$}{K(n)}}
\label{Lifting}

Fix a natural number $n\geq 3$.
Write $W_n:=W_{K(n)}$ for the free group generated by the arrows $\alpha_i$, $1\le i\le n$, of $K(n)$ and denote by $e\in W_n$ its identity element.
In this section, we fix compatible bases for each $H_m:=\Hom(P_m,P_{m+1})$ and use these to lift the (truncated) preprojective representations of the quiver $K(n)$ to the universal cover~$\widetilde{K(n)}$.
This lifting will rigidify the situation, allowing more precise control over these representations and their subrepresentation structure.
Of particular importance is Corollary~\ref{cor:perpendicular} which has no reasonable analogue for $K(n)$.
One main advantage of the lifting is that those truncated preprojectives which can be lifted are exceptional representations on the universal covering quiver $\widetilde{K(n)}$.

We will mainly be interested in particular lifts $\tilde P_m$ of the preprojective representations $P_m$ of $K(n)$ to the universal cover $\widetilde{K(n)}$.
In the notation of Definition~\ref{def:covering quivers}, this means $G(\tilde P_m)=P_m$, where $G$ is the covering functor 
\[G:=G_{K(n)}:\rep\widetilde{K(n)}\to\rep K(n).\]

To construct the lifts, first recall that applying the BGP-reflection functor $\Sigma_i$ on $K(n)$ corresponds to applying the iterated reflection $\tilde\Sigma_i:=\prod_{w\in W_n}\Sigma_{(i,w)}$ on $\widetilde{K(n)}$.
Moreover, under this operation all sinks of~$\widetilde{K(n)}$ become sources and vice versa.
The preprojective lifts we use are defined by the following analogue of the recursions of Remark~\ref{rem:reflection recursion}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item We consider the lift $\tilde P_1$ satisfying $\dim(\tilde P_1)_{(1,e)}=1$ and $\dim (\tilde P_1)_{(i,w)}=0$ for $(i,w)\neq (1,e)$.
  \item We consider the lift $\tilde P_2$ satisfying $\dim (\tilde P_2)_{(2,e)}=\dim (\tilde P_2)_{(1,\alpha_i)}=1$ for $1\le i\le n$ and $\dim(\tilde P_2)_{(i,w)}=0$ for $(i,w)\notin\{(2,e),(1,\alpha_1),\ldots,(1,\alpha_n)\}$.
  \item For $m\geq 3$, we build the lifts $\tilde P_m$ recursively by applying reflection functors or as Auslander-Reiten translates.
    More precisely, we set
    \begin{align}
      \label{eq:recursive covers}
      \tilde P_m:=\tilde\Sigma_2(\tilde P_{m-1})^{\sigma}\qquad\text{or}\qquad\tilde P_{m+1}:=\tilde\Sigma_{1}\tilde\Sigma_2\tilde P_{m-1}=\tau^{-1} \tilde P_{m-1},
    \end{align}
    where $(-)^\sigma:\rep\widetilde{K(n)}^{op}\to\rep\widetilde{K(n)}$ is the lift of the corresponding functor for $K(n)$.
\end{itemize}

It will be rather important that our chosen lifts of $P_{2l}$ for $l\ge1$ and our chosen lifts of $P_{2l-1}$ for $l\ge1$ live on two different components of the universal covering quiver.
Indeed, recall that the group $W_n$ naturally acts on $\widetilde{K(n)}_0$ via translation, i.e.~$w.(i,w')=(i,ww')$, and this induces an action of $W_n$ on $\rep\widetilde{K(n)}$.
Following the notation of Section~\ref{sec:covering}, we write $\tilde P_{m,w}$ for the representation of $\widetilde{K(n)}$ obtained by translating the lifted preprojective representation~$\tilde P_m$ by the action of $w\in W_n$.
To simplify the notation, we abbreviate $\tilde P_{2l-1,j}:=\tilde P_{2l-1,\alpha_j}$ and $\tilde P_{2l,j}:=\tilde P_{2l,\alpha_j^{-1}}$.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:shifted subreps}
  For each $m\ge1$, the representation $\tilde P_{m+1}$ has precisely $n$ subrepresentations covering $P_m$.
  These are the representations $\tilde P_{m,j}$ corresponding to the $n$ different arrows of $K(n)$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  This is clear for $m=1$ and follows in general by applying the identities \eqref{eq:recursive covers}.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
  Note that the dimension vectors of the lifted preprojectives $\tilde P_m$ are symmetric under permutations of the arrows of $K(n)$ (or rather the corresponding operation on $\widetilde{K(n)}$).
  In particular, they all have the same central vertex $(1,e)$ if $m$ is odd and central vertex $(2,e)$ if $m$ is even.
\end{remark}

\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:AR lift}
  For $m\ge2$, the Auslander-Reiten sequence~\eqref{eq:AR sequence} on $K(n)$ lifts to the Auslander-Reiten sequence
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lifted AR sequence}
    \xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & \tilde P_{m-1} \ar^(.4){\tilde\iota_{m-1}}[r] & \bigoplus_{j=1}^n \tilde P_{m,j} \ar[r] & \tilde P_{m+1} \ar[r] & 0}.
  \end{equation}
\end{corollary} 

\begin{example}
  \label{ex:lifted preprojectives}
  Here we explicitly describe the preprojective lifts $\tilde P_m$ for $m=2,3,4$ as well as their shifted preprojective subrepresentations as in Lemma~\ref{le:shifted subreps}.
  By Lemma~\ref{le:lifts of transjectives}, the lifts of all preprojectives are exceptional as representations of $\widetilde{K(n)}$ and thus they are uniquely determined by their dimension vectors.
  We make use of this fact below, stating only the support of the representation (also specifying those dimensions which are not one) and do not state the particular maps present in the lifts.
  We call this the \emph{support quiver} of the representation and let $W_n$ act on these quivers by translating all vertices.

  The representation $\tilde P_2$ is defined by the following quiver:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{dia:P2 quiver}
    \xymatrix@R40pt@C10pt{&(2,e)\ar_{\alpha_1}[ld]\ar^{\alpha_n}[rd]&\\ (1,\alpha_1)&\cdots&(1,\alpha_n)}
  \end{equation}
  Then $\tilde P_{1,j}\subset\tilde P_2$ corresponds to the one-dimensional space at vertex $(1,\alpha_j)$.
  Write $\cA_i$ for the quiver obtained from the one above by erasing the arrow $\alpha_i$ and the corresponding sink. 

  The representation $\tilde P_3$ is given by the quiver
  \begin{equation}
    \label{dia:P3 quiver}
    \xymatrix@R40pt@C10pt{&n-1&\\ \alpha_1^{-1}.\cA_1\ar^{\alpha_1}[ru]&\cdots&\alpha_n^{-1}.\cA_n\ar_{\alpha_n}[lu]}
  \end{equation}
  where the top vertex of dimension $n-1$ is $(1,e)$ and the arrow from each $\alpha_j^{-1}.\cA_j$ emanates from its unique source~$(2,\alpha_j^{-1})$.
  Then $\tilde P_{2,j}\subset\tilde P_3$ has one-dimensional spaces at each vertex of the quiver
  \[\xymatrix@R40pt@C10pt{&&&(1,e)&&&\\ &&&(2,\alpha_j^{-1})\ar_{\alpha_j}[u]\ar_{\alpha_1}[llld]\ar_(.65){\alpha_{j-1}}[ld]\ar^(.65){\alpha_{j+1}}[rd]\ar^{\alpha_n}[rrrd]&&&\\ (1,\alpha_j^{-1}\alpha_1)&\cdots&(1,\alpha_j^{-1}\alpha_{j-1})&&(1,\alpha_j^{-1}\alpha_{j+1})&\cdots&(1,\alpha_j^{-1}\alpha_n)}\]

  The representation $\tilde P_4$ has support quiver
  \begin{equation}
    \label{dia:P4 quiver}
    \xymatrix@R40pt@C10pt{&n-1\ar_{\alpha_1}[ld]\ar^{\alpha_n}[rd]&\\ \alpha_1.\cB_1&\cdots&\alpha_n.\cB_n}
  \end{equation}
  where the top vertex of dimension $n-1$ is $(2,e)$ and $\cB_i$ is the following analogue of the support quiver for $\tilde P_3$:
  \[\xymatrix@R40pt@C10pt{&&&2n-3&&&\\
    \alpha_1^{-1}.\cA_1\ar^{\alpha_1}[rrru]&\cdots&\alpha_{i-1}^{-1}.\cA_{i-1}\ar^(.35){\alpha_{i-1}}[ru]&\widehat{\alpha_i^{-1}.\cA_i}&\alpha_{i+1}^{-1}\cA_{i+1}\ar_(.35){\alpha_{i+1}}[lu]&\cdots&\alpha_n^{-1}\cA_n\ar_{\alpha_n}[lllu]}\]
  with top vertex $(1,e)$ having dimension $2n-3$.
  Now $\tilde P_{3,j}$ can be found as the subrepresentation corresponding to the subquiver
  \[\xymatrix@R40pt@C10pt{
    &&&\cA_j\ar^{\alpha_j}[d]&&&\\
    &&&n-1&&&\\
    \alpha_j\alpha_1^{-1}.\cA_1\ar^{\alpha_1}[rrru]&\cdots&\alpha_j\alpha_{j-1}^{-1}.\cA_{j-1}\ar^(.35){\alpha_{j-1}}[ru]&&\alpha_j\alpha_{j+1}^{-1}.\cA_{j+1}\ar_(.35){\alpha_{j+1}}[lu]&\cdots&\alpha_j\alpha_n^{-1}.\cA_n\ar_{\alpha_n}[lllu]}\]
  where the central vertex is $(1,\alpha_j)$.
  Note that taking the subquiver $\cA_j$ together with the image of the map $\alpha_j$ gives a subrepresentation of $\tilde P_{3,j}$ isomorphic to $\tilde P_2$ while taking the subquiver $\alpha_j\alpha_i^{-1}.\cA_i$ together with the image of the map $\alpha_i$ gives a subrepresentation of $\tilde P_{3,j}$ isomorphic to $\tilde P_{2,\alpha_j\alpha_i^{-1}}$.
\end{example}

The next result establishes some basic homological properties of the translated preprojective representations.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:homdecomposition}
  For $m\geq 1$, the following hold.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We have $\Hom(P_m,P_{m+1})\cong\bigoplus\limits_{i=1}^n \Hom(\tilde P_{m,i},\tilde P_{m+1})$, where each $\Hom(\tilde P_{m,i},\tilde P_{m+1})$ is one-dimensional.
    \item The representations $\tilde P_{m,i}$ are pairwise orthogonal, i.e.\ for $i\neq j$ we have 
      \[\Hom(\tilde P_{m,i},\tilde P_{m,j})=0=\Ext(\tilde P_{m,i},\tilde P_{m,j}).\]
    \item For $j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, we have
      \[\Hom(\tilde P_{m+1},\tilde P_{m,j})=0,\quad\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1},\tilde P_{m,j})=0,\quad\Ext(\tilde P_{m,j},\tilde P_{m+1})=0.\]
    \item For each proper subset $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$, there exists a truncated preprojective representation~$\tilde P_{m+1}^I$ fitting into an exact sequence 
      \begin{equation}
        \label{ses1}
        \sesm{\bigoplus_{i\in I} \tilde P_{m,i}}{\tilde P_{m+1}}{\tilde P_{m+1}^I}{\pi_{m+1}^I}.
      \end{equation}
      Moreover, $G(\tilde P_{m+1}^I)$ is a truncated preprojective of $K(n)$ for each $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{remark}
  Note that when $I=\varnothing$, it follows from the definition that $\tilde P_{m+1}^I=\tilde P_{m+1}$.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
  Part (1) is immediate from Theorem~\ref{covering}.
  Part (2) is also a consequence of Theorem~\ref{covering}.
  Indeed, for $1\leq j\leq n$, we have 
  $$\CC\cong\Hom(P_m,P_m)\cong\bigoplus_{i=1}^n \Hom(\tilde P_{m,i},\tilde P_{m,j}).$$
  But $\Hom(\tilde P_{m,j},\tilde P_{m,j})\cong\CC$ and so we must have $\Hom(\tilde P_{m,i},\tilde P_{m,j})=0$ for $i\neq j$.
  The vanishing of $\Ext(\tilde P_{m,i},\tilde P_{m,j})$ follows in the same manner using that $P_m$ is exceptional.

  Part (3) is clear for $m=1$ and follows for $m\ge2$ by applying the reflection recursion \eqref{eq:recursive covers}.

  For part (4), observe that under the isomorphism from part (1) the subset $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$ corresponds to the subspace $V\subset H_m$ spanned by the generators of the direct summands $\Hom(\tilde P_{m,i},\tilde P_{m+1})$ for $i\in I$.
  The map $\bigoplus_{i\in I} \tilde P_{m,i}\to\tilde P_{m+1}$ is then a lift of the evaluation morphism $ev_V:P_m\otimes V\to P_{m+1}$ and hence is injective by Lemma~\ref{le:injective evaluation maps}.
  Taking the cokernel defines the truncated preprojective $\tilde P_{m+1}^I$ and the preceding discussion shows that $G(\tilde P_{m+1}^I)\cong P_{m+1}^V$ is truncated preprojective as well.
\end{proof}

It will be important to understand the possible subrepresentations of the truncated preprojective representations $\tilde P_{m+1}^I$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:subrep}
  For $m\ge1$ and $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$, all non-trivial proper subrepresentations of $\tilde P_{m+1}^I$ are direct sums of preprojective representations.	
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By Lemma~\ref{le:homdecomposition}, the projected representation $G(\tilde P_{m+1}^I)$ is a truncated preprojective of $K(n)$.
  Then Lemma~\ref{le:projective subrepresentations} shows that all subrepresentations of $G(\tilde P_{m+1}^I)$ are direct sums of preprojective representations of $K(n)$.
  But any subrepresentation of $\tilde P_{m+1}^I$ also projects to a subrepresentation of $G(\tilde P_{m+1}^I)$.
  Since, following Lemma~\ref{le:lifts of transjectives}, any lift of a preprojective of $K(n)$ will be a preprojective representation of $\widetilde{K(n)}$, this gives the result.
\end{proof}

In what follows, we will need to understand the homological properties of the truncated preprojectives for $\widetilde{K(n)}$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:properties}
  For $m\geq1$ and $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$, the following hold.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For $j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, we have $\Ext(\tilde P_{m,j},\tilde P_{m+1}^I)=0$.  Also, $\Hom(\tilde P_{m,j},\tilde P_{m+1}^I)\ne0$ if and only if $j\not\in I$, in which case 
      \[\Hom(\tilde P_{m,j},\tilde P_{m+1}^I)\cong\Hom(\tilde P_{m,j},\tilde P_{m+1})\cong\CC.\]
    \item We have $\Hom(\tilde P_{m+1},\tilde P_{m+1}^I)\cong\CC$ and $\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1},\tilde P_{m+1}^I)=0$. 
    \item For $j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, we have $\Hom(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j})=0$.
      Also, $\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j})\ne0$ if and only if $j\in I$, in which case  
      \[\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j})\cong\CC.\] 
    \item For any $J\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$, we have $\Hom(\tilde P_{m+1}^J,\tilde P_{m+1}^I)\ne0$ if and only if $J\subset I$, in which case
      \[\Hom(\tilde P_{m+1}^J,\tilde P_{m+1}^I)\cong\CC\quad\text{and}\quad\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^J,\tilde P_{m+1}^I)=0.\]
      In particular, $\tilde P_{m+1}^I$ is an exceptional representation of $\widetilde{K(n)}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma} 
\begin{proof}
  Applying $\Hom(\tilde P_{m,j},-)$ to the sequence \eqref{ses1} gives the exact sequence
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & \Hom(\tilde P_{m,j},\bigoplus_{i\in I} \tilde P_{m,i}) \ar[r] & \Hom(\tilde P_{m,j},\tilde P_{m+1}) \ar[r] & \Hom(\tilde P_{m,j},\tilde P_{m+1}^I) \ar[r] & 0},\]
  where the final zero follows from Lemma~\ref{le:homdecomposition}.(2).
  This also gives an isomorphism $\Ext(\tilde P_{m,j},\tilde P_{m+1}^I)\cong\Ext(\tilde P_{m,j},\tilde P_{m+1})=0$ by Lemma~\ref{le:homdecomposition}.(3).
  Now the middle space in the sequence above is one-dimensional while the left-hand space vanishes if and only if $j\notin I$, this proves part (1).

  Part (2) is an immediate consequence of Lemma~\ref{le:unique preprojective morphism} together with Theorem~\ref{covering} or can be obtained directly by applying $\Hom(\tilde P_{m+1},-)$ to the sequence \eqref{ses1}.
  The first part of (3) follows from Theorem~\ref{covering} together with Lemma~\ref{le:basic homological properties}.
  For the second part of (3), we apply $\Hom(-,\tilde P_{m,j})$ to the sequence \eqref{ses1}.
  Then taking into account Lemma~\ref{le:homdecomposition} part (3), we get the isomorphism
  \[\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j})\cong\Hom(\textstyle{\bigoplus_{i\in I}}\tilde P_{m,i},\tilde P_{m,j}).\] 
  Then Lemma~\ref{le:homdecomposition}.(2) gives the final claim of part (3).

  Part (4) follows by applying $\Hom(-,\tilde P^I_{m+1})$ to the sequence \eqref{ses1} for $J$ then using parts (1) and (2).
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  \label{ex:truncated lifts}
  Fix $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
  Building on Example~\ref{ex:lifted preprojectives}, we describe here the truncated preprojectives $\tilde P_m^I$ for $m=2,3,4$.
  Following Lemma~\ref{le:properties}.(4), we can do this by simply specifying their dimension vectors as we did above.

  The support quiver of $\tilde P_2^I$ is obtained from the quiver \eqref{dia:P2 quiver} of $\tilde P_2$ by removing the sinks $(1,\alpha_i)$ for $i\in I$.
  The support quiver of $\tilde P_3^I$ is obtained from the quiver \eqref{dia:P3 quiver} of $\tilde P_3$ by removing the subquivers $\alpha_i^{-1}.\cA_i$ for $i\in I$ and decreasing the dimension of the space at vertex $(1,e)$ by $|I|$.

  The support quiver of $\tilde P_4^I$ is given by the following analogue of the quiver \eqref{dia:P4 quiver} of $\tilde P_4$:
  \[\xymatrix@R40pt@C10pt{&n-1-|I|\ar_{\alpha_1}[ld]\ar^{\alpha_n}[rd]&\\ \alpha_1.\cB_1^I&\cdots&\alpha_n.\cB_n^I}\]
  where the top vertex of dimension $n-1-|I|$ is again $(2,e)$ and $\cB_i^I$ is simply a space of dimension~$n-1-|I|$ if $i\in I$ and otherwise is the quiver
  \[\xymatrix@R40pt@C10pt{&&&2n-3-|I|&&&\\
    \alpha_1^{-1}.\cA_1\ar^{\alpha_1}[rrru]&\cdots&\alpha_{i-1}^{-1}.\cA_{i-1}\ar^(.35){\alpha_{i-1}}[ru]&\widehat{\alpha_i^{-1}.\cA_i}&\alpha_{i+1}^{-1}\cA_{i+1}\ar_(.35){\alpha_{i+1}}[lu]&\cdots&\alpha_n^{-1}\cA_n\ar_{\alpha_n}[lllu]}\]
\end{example} 


\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:truncated tau}
  For $m\ge3$ and $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$, we have $\tilde\Sigma_2(\tilde P_{m-1}^I)^\sigma=\tilde P_m^I$ and $\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^I=\tilde P_{m-1}^I$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By Lemma~\ref{le:homdecomposition}, we get the short exact sequence \eqref{ses1} defining the truncated preprojective $\tilde P_{m-1}^I$:
  \[\ses{\bigoplus_{i\in I} \tilde P_{m-2,i}}{\tilde P_{m-1}}{\tilde P_{m-1}^I}.\]
  Applying the functor $\tilde\Sigma_2(-)^\sigma$ to this sequence and recalling the reflection recursion \eqref{eq:recursive covers}, we obtain a short exact sequence
  \[\ses{\bigoplus_{i\in I} \tilde P_{m-1,i}}{\tilde P_m}{\tilde\Sigma_2(\tilde P_{m-1}^I)^\sigma}.\]
  The equality $\tilde\Sigma_2(\tilde P_{m-1}^I)^\sigma=\tilde P_m^I$ immediately follows.
  The equality $\tilde P_{m+1}^I=\tau^{-1}\tilde P_{m-1}^I$ is obtained in the same way using the functor $\tilde\Sigma_1\tilde\Sigma_2=\tau^{-1}$.
\end{proof}

We now introduce notation for locating specific lifted preprojectives as subrepresentations of our standard lifted preprojective representations.
Since we work only on two fixed components of $\widetilde{K(n)}$, the following notation will be useful in describing paths in these components.
For $k\ge1$, set
\[A_1^{(k)}:=\{(i_1,\ldots,i_k)\mid i_j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}\text{ for $1\le j\le k$}\}.\]%, i_j\ne i_{j+1}\text{ for $1\le j<l$}\}.\]
Depending on context (in particular, the parity of $m+1$ below), we will sometimes identify the word~$(i_1,\ldots,i_k)$ with the element $\alpha_{i_1}\alpha_{i_2}^{-1}\alpha_{i_3}\cdots\alpha_{i_k}^{(-1)^{k+1}}\in W_n$ and sometimes with the element $\alpha_{i_1}^{-1}\alpha_{i_2}\alpha_{i_3}^{-1}\cdots\alpha_{i_k}^{(-1)^k}\in W_n$.
In this way, to each word $\ui=(i_1,\ldots,i_k)\in A_1^{(k)}$ with $1\leq k\leq m$, we associate a preprojective subrepresentation~$\tilde P_{m+1-k,\ui}\subset\tilde P_{m+1}$ which lifts $P_{m+1-k}$.
More precisely, we obtain a sequence of preprojective subrepresentations which uniquely determines the desired inclusion:
\[\tilde P_{m+1-k,\ui}\subset\tilde P_{m+2-k,(i_1,\ldots,i_{k-1})}\subset\ldots\subset\tilde P_{m-1,(i_1,i_2)}\subset\tilde P_{m,i_1}\subset\tilde P_{m+1}.\]
Note that, although there is a translate of $\tilde P_{m+1-k}$ corresponding to each word $\ui\in A_1^{(l)}$ for $1\le l<k$, these will not be naturally equipped with a canonical inclusion to $\tilde P_{m+1}$.

To emphasize this point, consider a word $\ui\in A_1^{(k)}$ with $i_j=i_{j+1}$ for some $j$ and write $\ui'\in A_1^{(k-2)}$ for the word obtained from $\ui$ by removing the terms $i_j$ and $i_{j+1}$.
Then the representations $\tilde P_{m+1-k,\ui}$ and $\tilde P_{m+1-k,\ui'}$ are in fact equal, however $\tilde P_{m+1-k,\ui}$ is naturally identified as a subrepresentation of $\tilde P_{m+1}$ while $\tilde P_{m+1-k,\ui'}$ is not.
Indeed, by considering the support quiver of $\tilde P_{3,i}$ from Example~\ref{ex:lifted preprojectives}, we see that each $\tilde P_{2,(i,i)}$ is just a copy of $\tilde P_2$ when viewed as representations of $\widetilde{K(n)}$, however these provide distinct subrepresentations of $\tilde P_4$.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:special subrepresentations}
  Consider a nonempty subset $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and fix an element $j\in I$. 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For $m\ge2$, we have $\Hom(\tilde P_{m,j},\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^I)\cong\CC$.
      Moreover, the kernel of a nonzero morphism $\tilde P_{m,j}\to\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^I$ is the following representation 
      \[\tilde P_m(I,j):=
        \begin{cases}
          \bigoplus_{\substack{1\leq i\leq n\\i\neq j}}\tilde P_{m-1,(j,i)}\oplus \bigoplus_{i\in I, i\ne j}\tilde P_{m-2,(j,j,i)} & \text{ if $m\geq 3$;}\\
          \bigoplus_{\substack{1\leq i\leq n\\i\neq j}}\tilde P_{1,(j,i)} & \text{ if $m=2$.}
        \end{cases}\]
    \item For $m\ge3$, any nonzero morphism $\tilde P_{m,j}\to\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^I$ is surjective.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The first claim of part (1) follows immediately by applying the Auslander-Reiten formulas \cite[Theorem IV.2.13]{ass} to Lemma~\ref{le:properties}.(3).
  Indeed, this gives
  \[\dim\Hom(\tilde P_{m,j},\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^I)=\dim\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j})=1.\]
  We establish the final claim of part (1) directly for $m=2,3$ and then deduce the general case by applying the reflection recursions \eqref{eq:recursive covers}.
  Using the description in Example~\ref{ex:truncated lifts}, it is not hard to see that $\tau\tilde P_3^I$ is indecomposable with one-dimensional spaces at only the vertices $(1,e)$ and $(2,\alpha_i^{-1})$ for $i\in I$.
  But then for~$j\in I$, the image of the unique homomorphism $\tilde P_{2,j}\to\tau\tilde P_3^I$ is the representation with support quiver
  \[(2,\alpha_j^{-1})\xrightarrow{\alpha_j}(1,e).\]
  From the support quiver of $\tilde P_{2,j}$ given in Example~\ref{ex:lifted preprojectives}, we see that the kernel of this map is precisely $\tilde P_2(I,j)$.

  For the $m=3$ case, we note that $\tau\tilde P_4^I=\tilde P_2^I$ by Lemma~\ref{le:truncated tau}.
  Then the claimed structure $\tilde P_3(I,j)$ of the kernel and the surjectivity of the map $\tilde P_{3,j}\to\tau\tilde P_4^I$ are immediate from the explicit descriptions of $\tilde P_{3,j}$ and $\tilde P_2^I$ in Example~\ref{ex:lifted preprojectives} and Example~\ref{ex:truncated lifts} respectively.
  The general cases for parts (1) and (2) both then follow using the reflection recursions \eqref{eq:recursive covers} taking into account Remark~\ref{rem:reflection recursion}.(2).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  \label{rem:special case}
  We should point out that the case $m=2$ of Lemma~\ref{le:special subrepresentations} is rather special because it is the only one for which the unique morphism $\tilde P_{m,j}\to\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^I$ is not surjective.
  Indeed, recall from the proof of Lemma~\ref{le:special subrepresentations} that the image of the unique homomorphism $\tilde P_{2,j}\to\tau\tilde P_3^I$ is the representation with support quiver
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:special case}
    (2,\alpha_j^{-1})\xrightarrow{\alpha_j}(1,e).
  \end{equation}
  If we factor out the image of this morphism from $\tau\tilde P_3^I$, the remaining representation is a direct sum of the simple injective representations corresponding to the vertices $(2,\alpha_i^{-1})$ for $i\in I$, $i\ne j$.
  Note that these disappear after reflecting at all sources.
\end{remark}

The following orthogonality property is a primary reason we need to lift to the universal cover of $K(n)$.
\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:perpendicular}
  Consider a nonempty subset $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and fix an element $j\in I$.
  For $m\geq 2$, we have $\tilde P_m(I,j)\in (\tilde P_{m+1}^I)^\perp$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  If $m\geq 3$, we consider the long exact sequence obtained when applying $\Hom(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,-)$ to the sequence
  \[\ses{\tilde P_m(I,j)}{\tilde P_{m,j}}{\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^I}.\]
  Following Lemma~\ref{le:properties}.(3), we have $\Hom(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j})=0$ and using the long exact sequence this immediately implies $\Hom\big(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_m(I,j)\big)=0$.
  From Lemma~\ref{le:properties}.(3) again, we have $\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j})\cong\CC$.
  Using the Auslander-Reiten formulas \cite[Theorem IV.2.13]{ass} and Lemma~\ref{le:properties}.(4), we get
  \[\dim\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^I)=\dim\Hom(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m+1}^I)=1.\]
  It follows that the surjective map $\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j})\to\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^I)$ appearing in the long exact sequence is in fact an isomorphism.
  But the Auslander-Reiten formulas and Lemma~\ref{le:properties}.(4) again imply 
  \[\dim\Hom(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^I)=\dim\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m+1}^I)=0.\]
  Combining with the preceding discussion, this gives $\Ext\!\big(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_m(I,j)\big)=0$.
  
  If $m=2$, we have $\Hom\!\big(\tilde P_3^I,\tilde P_2(I,j)\big)=0$ since $\tilde P_2(I,j)$ is a direct sum of simple projective representations.
  Using the explicit description of $\tilde P_3^I$ from Example~\ref{ex:truncated lifts}, we see that each $\tilde P_{1,(j,i)}$ for $i\ne j$ is supported at a vertex which is not a neighbor of the support of $\tilde P_3^I$ and this implies $\Ext\!\big(\tilde P_3^I,\tilde P_{1,(j,i)}\big)=0$ for $i\neq j$.
\end{proof}

The next step is to introduce notation in order to locate truncated preprojectives as quotients of other truncated preprojectives in the universal covering.
\begin{definition}
  For $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$, write $I^c=\{1,\ldots,n\}\setminus I$ for the complementary subset.
  A sequence of subsets $\bfI=(I_0,I_1,\ldots,I_k)$, $k\ge0$, in $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ is \emph{admissible} if the following hold:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item if $k\ge1$, then $|I_0|=n-1$ and $|I_l|=n-2$ for $1\le l\le k-1$;
    \item the sets $I'_l$ defined recursively by $I'_0=I_0$ and $I'_{l+1}:=I_{l+1}\cup (I'_l)^c$ for $0\le l\le k$ satisfy $(I'_l)^c\cap I_{l+1}=\varnothing$ for $0\le l\le k$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Here we take $I_{k+1}=\varnothing$ so that there is no condition imposed on the set $(I'_k)^c$.
  Given an admissible sequence $\bfI=(I_0,\ldots,I_k)$ with $k\ge1$, define a new admissible sequence $\delta\bfI=(I'_1,I_2,\ldots,I_k)$.
\end{definition}

In the same way as for the preprojective lifts $\tilde P_{m+1}$, $m\ge1$, we can define truncated preprojectives $\tilde P_{m+1,w}^I$ of any translate $\tilde P_{m+1,w}$, where $w\in W_n$ and $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
That is, taking $\varepsilon=(-1)^{m+1}$ we have an exact sequence
\[\ses{\bigoplus_{i\in I} \tilde P_{m,w\alpha_i^\varepsilon}}{\tilde P_{m+1,w}}{\tilde P_{m+1,w}^I}.\]
These quotients are unique in the sense that $\Hom(\tilde P_{m+1,w},\tilde P_{m+1,w}^I)=\CC$ for all $w\in W_n$ and $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
We adopt similar notation for truncated preprojectives $\tilde P_{m+1-k,\ui}^I$ for $\ui\in A_1^{(k)}$ and $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$.

By Lemma~\ref{le:properties}.(1), we can quotient out the lifted preprojectives successively, i.e.\ for any proper subsets $J\subsetneq I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$ we have a short exact sequence
\[\sesm{\bigoplus_{i\in I\setminus J}\tilde P_{m,i}}{\tilde P_{m+1}^J}{\tilde P_{m+1}^I}{\pi_{m+1}^{J,I}}.\]
For any sequence of proper subsets $K\subsetneq J\subsetneq I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$, the quotient maps satisfy $\pi_{m+1}^{K,I}=\pi_{m+1}^{J,I}\circ\pi_{m+1}^{K,J}$ and $\pi_{m+1}^I=\pi_{m+1}^{J,I}\circ\pi_{m+1}^J$.
For $w\in W_n$, we write $\pi_{m+1,w}^{I,J}:\tilde P_{m+1,w}^I\to\tilde P_{m+1,w}^J$ for the translated morphism with similar notation for truncated preprojectives $\tilde P_{m+1-k,\ui}^I$ for $\ui\in A_1^{(k)}$ and $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:truncated quotients}
  For $m\ge3$, the following hold:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$ with $|I|=n-1$ and $I^c=\{j\}$, we have an isomorphism 
      \[\tilde P_{m+1}^I\cong\tilde P_{m,j}^{I^c}=\tilde P_{m,j}/\tilde P_{m-1,(j,j)}.\]
    \item Consider an admissible sequence $\bfI=(I_0,\ldots,I_k)$ with $0<k<m$ and write $(I'_l)^c=\{i_l\}=:J_l$ for $0\le l\le k-1$.
      For $\ui=(i_0,\ldots,i_{k-1})$, there exists a commutative diagram:
      \begin{equation}
        \label{dia:truncated coherence}
        \xymatrix@R40pt@C70pt{\tilde P_{m+1} \ar^(.4){\pi_{m+1}^{I'_0}}[d] & \ar[l] \tilde P_{m,i_0} \ar_(.4){\pi_{m,i_0}^{J_0}}[dl]\ar^(.4){\pi_{m,i_0}^{I'_1}}[d] & \ar[l] \tilde P_{m-1,(i_0,i_1)} \ar_(.4){\pi_{m-1,(i_0,i_1)}^{J_1}\;}[dl]\ar^(.4){\pi_{m-1,(i_0,i_1)}^{I'_2}}[d] & \ar[l] \ar[dl] \cdots & \ar[l] \tilde P_{m+1-k,\ui} \ar_(.4){\pi_{m+1-k,\ui}^{J_{k-1}}\;}[dl]\ar^(.4){\pi_{m+1-k}^{I'_k}}[d]\\
        \tilde P_{m+1}^{I'_0}\ar^{\pi_{m,i_0}^{J_0,I'_1}}[r] & \tilde P_{m,i_0}^{I'_1}\ar^{\pi_{m-1,(i_0,i_1)}^{J_1,I'_2}}[r] & \tilde P_{m-1,(i_0,i_1)}^{I'_2}\ar^(.6){\pi_{m-2,(i_0,i_1,i_2)}^{J_2,I'_3}}[r] & \cdots\ar^{\pi_{m+1-k,\ui}^{J_{k-1},I'_k}}[r] & \tilde P_{m+1-k,\ui}^{I'_k}}
      \end{equation}
      where the composed map $\pi_{m+1}^\bfI:\tilde P_{m+1}\to\tilde P_{m+1-k,\ui}^{I'_k}$ is unique up to scaling and therefore we write
      \[\tilde P_{m+1}^\bfI:=\tilde P_{m+1-k,\ui}^{I'_k}.\]
      These truncated preprojective representations satisfy 
      \[\tilde P_{m+1}^\bfI=\tilde P_{m,i_0}^{\delta\bfI}=\cdots=\tilde P_{m+1-k,\ui}^{\delta^k\bfI}.\]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The Auslander-Reiten sequence~\eqref{eq:lifted AR sequence} gives rise to the following commutative diagram:
  \[\xymatrix{& & 0\ar[d]& 0\ar[d]&\\
    & & \bigoplus_{i\in I} \tilde P_{m,i}\ar[d]\ar@{=}[r]& \bigoplus_{i\in I} \tilde P_{m,i}\ar[d]&\\
    0\ar[r]&\tilde P_{m-1} \ar[r]\ar@{=}[d] & \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \tilde P_{m,i}\ar[d]\ar[r]\ar@{}[dr]|(.7){\lrcorner} & \tilde P_{m+1}\ar[r]\ar[d]& 0\\
    0\ar[r] &\tilde P_{m-1}\ar[r] &  \tilde P_{m,j}\ar[r]\ar[d] & \tilde P_{m+1}^I\ar[r]\ar[d] & 0\\
  & & 0& 0&}\]
  The image of the inclusion $\tilde P_{m-1}\into \tilde P_{m,j}$ in the bottom row is the subrepresentation $\tilde P_{m-1,(j,j)}\subset\tilde P_{m,j}$ and part (1) follows.

  The first claim of part (2) is then immediate by repeatedly applying part (1) while the final claim of part (2) is a consequence of the definition of $\delta$.
\end{proof}

\section{Quiver Grassmannians}
\label{QG}

\subsection{Torus Actions and the Bia\l{}ynicki-Birula Decomposition}
The aim of Section~\ref{torusaction} is to define a torus action on quiver Grassmannians which can be used to simplify the calculation of homological invariants in general.
If the quiver Grassmannian is smooth, which is for instance the case for exceptional representations by \cite{cr}, it can also be used to stratify the quiver Grassmannians using the results of Bia\l{}ynicki-Birula.
More specifically, let $X$ be a smooth projective variety with a $\C^\ast$-action.
For a connected component of the fixed point set $C\subset X^{\C^\ast}$, we define its attracting set as
\[\Att(C):=\{y\in X\mid \lim_{t\to 0}t.y\in C\}.\]
The following result of Bia\l{}ynicki-Birula relates the geometry of $X$ to the geometry of its torus fixed points.
\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:bb}
  \cite[Section 4]{bb}
  Each attracting set $\Att(C)$ is a locally closed $\CC^*$-invariant subvariety of $X$ and the natural map $\Att(C)\to C$ is a vector bundle.
  Moreover, assuming $X^{\C^\ast}=\coprod_{i=1}^r C_i$ is a decomposition of the fixed point set of $X$ into finitely many connected components, we have $X=\coprod_{i=1}^r \Att(C_i)$.
  In particular, we have an equality of Euler characteristics $\chi(X)=\chi(X^{\C^\ast})$.
\end{theorem}

If each component $C_i$ admits a decomposition into affine spaces, Theorem~\ref{thm:bb} implies the same is true of $X$.
Indeed, we can trivialize each vector bundle $\Att(C_i)\to C_i$ over each affine piece of $C_i$ to get a decomposition of $X$ into affine spaces.


\subsection{Torus Actions on Quiver Grassmannians}
\label{torusaction}
Fix a vector space $X$ of dimension $n$ and let $k\leq n$.
We first consider a natural torus action on the usual Grassmannian $\Gr_k(X)$ which is compatible with a given direct sum decomposition of the vector space $X$.
Then we generalize the concept to quiver Grassmannians and observe that the torus fixed point sets can be calculated in an analogous manner.

Given a basis $\mathcal B=\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ of $X$ and a map $d:\{1,\ldots,n\}\to\ZZ$, we get a $\C^\ast$-action on $X$ when linearly extending the definition $t.v_r:=t^{d(r)}v_r$ for $r=1,\ldots,n$ to all of $X$.
This naturally induces an action of $\C^\ast$ on the Grassmannian $\Gr_k(X)$.
Our goal is to understand the fixed points of such an action.

For this recall that we can represent each subspace~$U\in\Gr_k(X)$ uniquely by a $k\times n$ matrix $M(U)$ whose rows provide a basis for $U$ when expanded as coefficient vectors in the basis $\mathcal B$.
The uniqueness of $M(U)$ comes from requiring that it be in row-echelon form, i.e.\ there exists a unique sequence $1\leq i_1<\ldots<i_k\leq n$ so that $M(U)$ is of the form
\[M(U):=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \ast&\cdots &\ast &1&0 &\cdots& 0 & 0 & 0 &\cdots&0&0&0&\cdots&0\\
    \ast&\cdots &\ast&0&\ast&\cdots &\ast&1&0&\cdots&0&0&0&\cdots&0\\
    \ast &\cdots&\ast&0&\ast &\cdots&\ast&0&\ast&\cdots&0&0&0&\cdots&0\\[-0.4em]
    \vdots &\ddots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots &\ddots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
    \ast&\cdots &\ast&0&\ast&\cdots &\ast&0&\ast&\cdots&0&0&0&\cdots&0\\
    \ast&\cdots &\ast&0&\ast&\cdots &\ast&0&\ast&\cdots&\ast&1&0&\cdots&0
  \end{pmatrix}\in M_{k,n}(\CC),\]
where the unit vectors are in the columns $\bfi=(i_1,\ldots,i_k)$.
The set of all $U\in\Gr_k(X)$ represented by matrices of this fixed form gives the \emph{Schubert cell} $X_\bfi$.

The $\C^\ast$-action on $U\in\Gr_k(X)$ can then be described in terms of the matrix representation $M(U)$, that is for $U\in X_\bfi$ we have
\[M(t.U)_{qr}=t^{d(r)-d(i_q)} M(U)_{qr}\]
for $q=1,\ldots,k$ and $r=1,\ldots,n$.
Observe that each Schubert cell $X_\bfi$ is invariant under this torus action.

Assume that $X=\bigoplus_{l=1}^m X_l$ is a direct sum decomposition of $X$ and fix a basis $\mathcal B=\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ of~$X$ which is compatible with this decomposition, i.e.\ there exist numbers $0=r_0<r_1<r_2<\cdots<r_{m-1}<r_m=n$ such that
\[v_{r_0+1},\ldots,v_{r_1}\in X_1,\quad v_{r_1+1},\ldots,v_{r_2}\in X_2,\quad\cdots\quad v_{r_{m-1}+1},\ldots,v_{r_m}\in X_m.\]
\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:usualGrass}
  Consider a map $d:\{1,\ldots,n\}\to\ZZ$ such that $d(r)=d(r')$ if $v_r,v_{r'}\in X_l$ for some $l$ and $d(r)\neq d(r')$ if $v_r\in X_l$ and $v_{r'}\in X_{l'}$ with $l\neq l'$.
  Then under the $\CC^*$-action determined by $d$, we have $U\in\Gr_k(X)^{\C^\ast}$ if and only if $U=\bigoplus_{l=1}^m U\cap X_l$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Assume $U=\bigoplus_{l=1}^m U\cap X_l$.
  Then any $u\in U$ can be written uniquely as $u=\sum_{l=1}^m u_l$ for some $u_l\in U\cap X_l$.
  It follows that $t.u=\sum_{l=1}^m t.u_l=\sum_{l=1}^m t^{d(r_l)}u_l\in\bigoplus_{l=1}^m U\cap X_l=U$ and thus $t.U=U$. 

  For the reverse direction, assume $U\in X_{\bfi}$ is a torus fixed point represented by the matrix $M(U)$.
  Then, if~$v_{i_q}\in X_l$, the assumptions on $d$ imply $M(U)_{qr}=0$ unless $r_{l-1}+1\le r\le r_l$.
  That is, $M(U)$ has the shape of a block matrix representing the decomposition $U=\bigoplus_{l=1}^m U\cap X_l$.
\end{proof}
The next step is to generalize this to quiver Grassmannians.
Let $Q$ be an acyclic quiver.
We choose a map $d:\hat Q_0\to\ZZ$ and fix a representation $X\in\rep Q$ which can be lifted to $\hat Q$.
We can consider the decomposition $X_i=\bigoplus_{\chi\in A_Q} X_{(i,\chi)}$ and define a torus action on each $X_{(i,\chi)}$ via $t.x_{(i,\chi)}=t^{d(i,\chi)}x_{(i,\chi)}$ which can be extended linearly to each $X_i$.
Associated to each subspace $U_i$, there is a corresponding subspace $t.U_i$ for each $t\in\CC^*$.
In general, this does not induce a torus action on the quiver Grassmannians $\Gr_\bfe(X)$ since $t.U=(t.U_i)_{i\in Q_0}$ is not necessarily a subrepresentation of $X$ for every $U\in\Gr_\bfe(X)$.
Indeed, for this such an action must satisfy $X_\alpha(t.U_i)\subset t.U_j$ for every arrow $\alpha:i\to j$ of $Q$ and every $t\in\CC^*$. 
\begin{lemma}
  Let $X$ be a representation of $Q$ which can be lifted to $\hat Q$.
  Fix an integer $c_\alpha\in\ZZ$ for each~$\alpha\in Q_1$.
  Suppose $d:\hat Q_0\to\ZZ$ satisfies $d(j,\chi+e_\alpha)-d(i,\chi)=c_\alpha$ for each arrow $\alpha:i\to j$ of $Q$ and each $\chi\in A_Q$.
  Then the torus action on $X$ determined by $d$ induces a torus action on $\Gr_\bfe(X)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} 
  Fix $U\in\Gr_\bfe(X)$ and consider $u_i\in U_i$.
  Since $U$ is a subrepresentation, for an arrow $\alpha:i\to j$ of $Q$ we may write $X_\alpha(u_i)=u_j$ for some $u_j\in U_j$.

  As $X$ can be lifted to $\hat Q$, for any arrow $\alpha\in Q_1$ we can write $X_\alpha:X_i\to X_j$ as a block matrix consisting of linear maps $X_{(\alpha,\chi)}:X_{(i,\chi)}\to X_{(j,\chi+e_\alpha)}$ for $\chi\in A_Q$.
  Then writing $u_i=\sum_{\chi\in A_Q} u_{(i,\chi)}$ for some vectors $u_{(i,\chi)}\in X_{(i,\chi)}$, we have $X_\alpha(u_{(i,\chi)})=X_{(\alpha,\chi)}(u_{(i,\chi)})\in X_{(j,\chi+e_\alpha)}$, say $X_{(\alpha,\chi)}(u_{(i,\chi)})=u_{(j,\chi+e_\alpha)}$.
  It follows that $u_j=\sum_{\chi\in A_Q} u_{(j,\chi+e_\alpha)}$ and so
  \begin{align*}
    X_\alpha(t.u_i)
    &=\sum\limits_{\chi\in A_Q} t^{d(i,\chi)}X_{(\alpha,\chi)}(u_{(i,\chi)})=\sum\limits_{\chi\in A_Q} t^{d(i,\chi)}u_{(j,\chi+e_\alpha)}=t^{-c_\alpha}\sum\limits_{\chi\in A_Q} t.u_{(j,\chi+e_\alpha)}=t^{-c_\alpha} t.u_j.
  \end{align*}
  Therefore $X_\alpha(t.U_i)\subset t.U_j$ for every arrow $\alpha:i\to j$ of $Q$ and we obtain a $\CC^*$-action on $\Gr_\bfe(X)$.
\end{proof}

The next result provides conditions required of the map $d:\hat Q_0\to\ZZ$ needed to get an analogue of Lemma~\ref{le:usualGrass}
\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:degree condition} 
  Let $\hat X$ be an indecomposable representation of $\hat Q$.
  There exists $d:\supp(X)\to\ZZ$ and $c_\alpha\in\mathbb N_+$ for each $\alpha\in Q_1$ such that
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item for $(i,\chi),\,(i,\chi')\in\supp(X)$ with $\chi\neq\chi'$, we have $d(i,\chi)\ne d(i,\chi')$;
    \item for $(i,\chi),\,(j,\chi')\in\supp(X)$, we have $d(j,\chi')-d(i,\chi)=c_\alpha$ if and only if $\chi'=\chi+e_\alpha$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  For convenience we introduce the notation $Q_1=\{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n\}$.
  Since $X$ is finite-dimensional and indecomposable, the support quiver $\supp(X)$ is a connected and finite subquiver of $\hat Q$.
  In order to prove the statement, we may assume that $(i',0)\in\supp(X)$ for some $i'\in Q_0$.
  Let $K$ be the maximal length of a path in $\supp(X)$ starting or ending in $(i',0)$ such that the underlying graph of the path has no cycles.
  This implies that, for $(i,\chi)\in\supp(X)$ with $\chi=\sum_{l=1}^n \kappa_l e_{\alpha_l}$, we have $|\kappa_l|\leq K$.

  Set $c_{\alpha_1}=1$ and choose $c_{\alpha_l}$ recursively in such way that 
  \[c_{\alpha_l}\geq 2(K+1)\sum_{k=1}^{l-1} c_{\alpha_k}\]
  for $l=2,\ldots,n$.  
  Then let $f:A_Q\to\ZZ$ be the group homomorphism defined by $f(e_\alpha)=c_\alpha$ for all $\alpha\in Q_1$ and define $d(i,\chi):=f(\chi)$ for $(i,\chi)\in\supp(X)$.
  %In particular, for $(i',\chi)$ with $\chi=\sum_{l=1}^n \kappa_l e_{\alpha_l}$, we have
  %\[d(i',\chi)=\sum_{l=1}^n \kappa_l c_{\alpha_l}.\]

  To check property (1), assume that $d(i,\chi)=d(i,\chi')$ for $\chi=\sum_{l=1}^n \kappa_l e_{\alpha_l}$ and $\chi'=\sum_{l=1}^n \kappa'_l e_{\alpha_l}$.
  This implies
  \[\sum_{l=1}^{n-1}(\kappa_l-\kappa'_l)c_{\alpha_l}=(\kappa'_n-\kappa_n)c_{\alpha_n}.\]
  But we have $|\kappa_l-\kappa'_l|\leq |\kappa_l|+|\kappa'_l|\le 2K$ and thus we obtain 
  \[|\kappa'_n-\kappa_n|c_{\alpha_n}=\left|\sum_{l=1}^{n-1}(\kappa_l-\kappa'_l)c_{\alpha_l}\right|\le 2K\sum_{l=1}^{n-1}c_{\alpha_l} < c_{\alpha_n}.\]
  This inductively yields $\kappa_l=\kappa'_l$ for $l=n,\ldots,1$ by the choice of the $c_{\alpha_l}$ and thus $\chi=\chi'$. 

  By definition, we have $d(j,\chi+e_\alpha)-d(i,\chi)=c_\alpha$ when $(j,\chi+e_\alpha)\in\supp(X)$.
  Now assuming $d(j,\chi')-d(i,\chi)=c_\alpha$, an analogous argument to the one above shows that $\chi'=\chi+e_\alpha$.
\end{proof}

In the following, we say that $d:\supp(X)\to\ZZ$ satisfies the \emph{degree condition} for $X$ if it has the properties of Lemma~\ref{le:degree condition}.
\begin{theorem}
  Let $X$ be a representation of $Q$ which can be lifted to a representation $\hat X$ of $\hat Q$ and choose $d:\supp(\hat X)\to\ZZ$ such that it satisfies the degree condition for $X$.
  Then the torus action on $\bigoplus_{i\in Q_0} X_i$ induced by $t.x_{(i,\chi)}=t^{d(i,\chi)}x_{(i,\chi)}$ for $x_{(i,\chi)}\in X_{(i,\chi)}$ induces a torus action on $\Gr_\bfe^Q(X)$ such that
  \[\Gr^Q_\bfe(X)^{\CC^*}\cong\bigsqcup_{\hat\bfe} \Gr^{\hat Q}_{\hat\bfe}(\hat X),\]
  where $\hat\bfe$ runs through all dimension vectors compatible with $\bfe$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  A representation $U\in\Gr_{\bfe}(X)$ is a torus fixed point if and only if $t.U=U$ for all $t\in\C^\ast$, i.e.\ $t.U_i=U_i$ for all $i\in Q_0$ and all $t\in\C^\ast$.
  Thus, apart from being a subrepresentation of $X$, each component $U_i$ is a fixed point of the induced torus actions on the usual Grassmannian $\Gr_{\bfe_i}(X_i)$.
  By Lemma~\ref{le:usualGrass}, this holds precisely when we have a decomposition 
  \[U_i=\bigoplus_{\chi\in A_Q} U_i\cap X_{(i,\chi)}\]
  which is equivalent to $U$ being liftable to the universal abelian covering.
\end{proof}
The next step is to iterate the torus action keeping in mind the following idea: every representation, which lifts to the universal covering quiver, also lifts to the universal abelian covering quiver and also to the iterated universal abelian covering quivers, i.e.\ to $\hat Q^{(k)}:=\widehat{\hat Q^{(k-1)}}$ with $\hat Q=\hat Q^{(1)}$.
Now it is straightforward to check that there exist natural surjective morphisms $f_k:\widetilde Q\to \hat Q^{(k)}$ which become injective on finite subquivers if $k\gg 0$, see also \cite[Section 3.4]{wei}.
Since the support of $X$ is finite as a representation of $\tilde Q$, we can find $k\geq 1$ such that the full subquiver with vertices $\supp(X)\subseteq \hat Q^{(k)}_0$ is a tree.
Thus, if $\hat X^{(k)}$ is the lift of $X$ to $\hat Q^{(k)}$, there exists a torus action on the vector spaces $\hat X^{(k)}_i$ which induce a torus action on the quiver Grassmannian $\Gr_{\bfe}^{\hat Q^{(k)}}(\hat X^{(k)})$.
If we denote the iterated torus fixed points by $\Gr^Q_\bfe(X)^{T^{(k)}}$, we obtain the following result.
\begin{corollary}
Let $X$ be a representation which can be lifted to $\tilde Q$. Then there exists an iterated torus action such that
  $$\Gr^Q_\bfe(X)^{T^{(k)}}\cong \bigsqcup_{\hat\bfe^{(k-1)}} \Gr_{\hat\bfe^{(k-1)}}^{\hat Q^{(k-1)}}(\hat X^{(k-1)})^T\cong \bigsqcup_{\hat\bfe^{(k)}} \Gr^{\hat Q^{(k)}}_{\hat\bfe^{(k)}}(\hat X^{(k)})\cong \bigsqcup_{\tilde\bfe} \Gr^{\tilde Q}_{\tilde\bfe}(\tilde X)$$ where $\hat\bfe^{(k-1)},\,\hat\bfe^{(k)},\,\tilde\bfe$ run through all dimension vectors compatible with $\bfe$.
\end{corollary}
%\begin{corollary}
%  affine bundles over $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_{\tilde\bfe}(\tilde X)$ if $\Gr^Q_\bfe(X)$ is smooth
%  \[\{U\in \Gr^Q_\bfe(X):\lim_{t\to0} t\cdot U\in \Gr^{\tilde Q}_{\tilde\bfe}(\tilde X)\}\]
%\end{corollary}
Define the $F$-polynomial of a representation $X$ by 
$$F_X=\sum_{\bfe\in\NN^{Q_0}}\chi(\Gr_\bfe(X))x^\bfe\in\ZZ[x_i\mid i\in Q_0].$$

\begin{corollary}\label{fpoly}
Let $X$ be a representation which can be lifted to the universal covering quiver.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
If  $\Gr_\bfe(X)$ is smooth and $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_{ \tbfe}(\tilde X)$ has a cell decomposition into affine spaces, then $\Gr_\bfe(X)$ has a cell decomposition into affine spaces.
\item We have $F_X=SF_{\tilde X}$ where $SF_{\tilde X}$ is obtained from $F_{\tilde X}$ by applying $S:\ZZ[x_{(i,w)}\mid i\in Q_0,w\in W_Q]\to\ZZ[x_i\mid i\in Q_0]$ given by $S(x_{(i,w)})=x_i$ for all $i\in Q_0$ and $w\in W_Q$.
\end{enumerate} 
\end{corollary}
An important special case for this is the case of exceptional representations. In this case the quiver Grassmannians $\Gr_\tbfe(X)$ are smooth by \cite[Corollary 4]{cr}. Moreover, every exceptional representation is a tree module by \cite{rin1} which means that it can be lifted to the universal covering.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\mathbf{GL_n}$}{Gln}-Action on Arrows of \texorpdfstring{$\mathbf{K(n)}$}{K(n)}}
The goal of this section is to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:truncpp} showing that quiver Grassmannians of truncated preprojectives $P_{m+1}^V$ are smooth and only depend on the dimension of the subspace $V\subsetneq H_m$.
We begin by observing that $GL_n(\CC)$ naturally acts on the vector space $A_1=\bigoplus_{i=1}^n \CC\alpha_i$ spanned by the arrows of $K(n)$ and hence $GL_n(\CC)$ acts on $\rep K(n)$ via the induced action on the path algebra $A(n)$.
More precisely, given a representation $M=(M_1,M_2,M_{\alpha_i})$ of $K(n)$ and $g=(g_{ij})\in GL_n(\CC)$, the representation $g.M$ is given by $(M_1,M_2,(g.M)_{\alpha_i})$ with $(g.M)_{\alpha_i}=\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}M_{\alpha_j}$.
Note that $M$ and $g.M$ are not necessarily isomorphic as representations of $K(n)$.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:hom equivariance}
  For any morphism $\theta:M\to N$ between representations $M,N\in\rep K(n)$, the same maps $\theta_1:M_1\to N_1$ and $\theta_2:M_2\to N_2$ give a morphism $\theta^g:g.M\to g.N$ for any $g\in GL_n(\CC)$.
  In particular, the hom-spaces $\Hom(M,N)$ and $\Hom(g.M,g.N)$ are canonically identified for each $g\in G$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $\theta:M\to N$ is a morphism of representations, i.e.\ $\theta_2\circ M_{\alpha_j}=N_{\alpha_j}\circ\theta_1$ for $1\le j\le n$.
  Then for $g=(g_{ij})\in GL_n(\CC)$ and $1\le i\le n$, we have
  \[\theta_2\circ (g.M)_{\alpha_i}=\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}(\theta_2\circ M_{\alpha_j})=\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}(N_{\alpha_j}\circ\theta_1)=(g.N)_{\alpha_i}\circ\theta_1\]
  so that $\theta$ also gives a morphism from $g.M$ to $g.N$. 
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:indecomposability}
  For $M\in\rep K(n)$ and $g\in GL_n(\CC)$, the representation $M$ is indecomposable if and only if $g.M$ is indecomposable.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  The representation $M$ is decomposable if there exists a split epimorphism $\theta:M\onto N$ for some nonzero representation $N$.
  But this occurs exactly when the map $\theta^g:g.M\onto g.N$ is also a split epimorphism.
\end{proof}

%Write $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ for the BGP-reflection functors of $K(n)$ \cite{bgp}. 
%Note that (up to relabeling vertices) the quiver $K(n)$ itself does not change when applying the reflection functors and thus we view these as endofunctors acting on the category $\rep K(n)$. 
%With this identification of $K(n)$ and $K(n)^{op}$, the endofunctors $\Sigma_2\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_1\Sigma_2$ are each naturally isomorphic to the identity maps on the full subcategories $\rep_{\langle 1\rangle} K(n),\rep_{\langle 2\rangle} K(n)\subset \rep K(n)$, where the objects of $\rep_{\langle i\rangle} K(n)$ are those representations of $K(n)$ which do not contain the simple $S_i$ as a direct summand.
%Also, following \cite{brenner-butler}, the Auslander-Reiten translation $\tau:\rep K(n)\to\rep K(n)$ may be identified with the functor $\Sigma_1^2$.

While the reflection functors are not $GL_n(\CC)$-equivariant, they do admit the following twisted equivariance.
\begin{lemma}\label{compatibleGSigma}
  For $g\in G$, the reflection functors $\Sigma_i:\rep K(n)\to\rep K(n)$ satisfy $g.\Sigma_i(M)=\Sigma_i(g^{-T}.M)$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We present all the details for $\Sigma_2$, the proof for $\Sigma_1$ is similar.
  For $M\in\rep K(n)$, we have $\Sigma_2(M)=(M_1,M'_2,M'_{\alpha_i})$, where $M'_2$ fits into the following exact sequence:
  \[\xymatrix@C30pt{0 \ar[r] & M_2 \ar[r]^(.4){\bigoplus\limits_{i=1}^n M_{\alpha_i}} & \bigoplus\limits_{i=1}^n M_1 \ar[r]^\pi & M'_2 \ar[r] & 0}\]
  and $M'_{\alpha_i}=\pi\circ\iota_i$ for $\iota_i:M_1\to\bigoplus_{i=1}^n M_1$ the inclusion of the $i$-th factor.
  Then for $g=(g_{ij})\in GL_n(\CC)$, we have $g.\Sigma_2(M)=(M_1,M'_2,(g.M')_{\alpha_i})$ with 
  \[(g.M')_{\alpha_i}=\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}M'_{\alpha_j}=\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}(\pi\circ\iota_j)=\pi\circ\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}\iota_j=\pi\circ g^T\circ\iota_i.\]
  In particular, we may construct $g.\Sigma_2(M)$ using the following exact sequence:
  \[\xymatrix@C50pt{0 \ar[r] & M_2 \ar[r]^(.45){g^{-T}\circ\bigoplus\limits_{i=1}^n M_{\alpha_i}} & \bigoplus\limits_{i=1}^n M_1 \ar[r]^{\pi\circ g^T} & M'_2 \ar[r] & 0},\]
  i.e. $g.\Sigma_2(M)=\Sigma_2(g^{-T}.M)$.
\end{proof}

%\begin{corollary}
%  \label{cor:preprojective stability}
%  For $m\ge1$ and $g\in G$, the representations $P_m$ and $g.P_m$ are isomorphic.
%\end{corollary}
%\begin{proof}
%  By construction, the representation $g.P_m$ also has dimension vector $(u_m,u_{m-1})$ and is indecomposable by Corollary~\ref{cor:indecomposability}.
%  Thus by Theorem~\ref{th:rigids}, $P_m$ and $g.P_m$ are isomorphic.
%\end{proof}
%For $g\in GL_n(\CC)$, write $\phi_{m,g}:P_m\to g.P_m$ for the (unique up to scalars) isomorphism from Corollary~\ref{cor:preprojective stability}.

%\begin{lemma}
%  \label{le:transitivity}
%  The action of $GL_n(\CC)$ on $H_m$ induces a transitive action of $GL_n(\CC)$ on each component $\Gr_d(H_m)$.
%\end{lemma} 
%\begin{proof}
%  The map $\theta\mapsto g.\theta$ for $\theta\in H_m$ induces a group homomorphism $GL_n(\CC)\to GL(H_m)$ which we denote by $g\mapsto\tilde g_m$.
%  We claim that this homomorphism is surjective which immediately implies the result.
%
%  We work by induction on $m$.
%  Suppose $GL_n(\CC)\to GL(H_m)$ is surjective.
%
%\end{proof}

%Similarly, for $V^g\in \Gr(H_m^g)$, we identify $g.P_m\otimes V^g$ with its image in $g.P_{m+1}$ under the natural evaluation map. 
%\begin{lemma}
%  \label{le:g equalities}
%  For any $g\in GL_n(\CC)$, the subrepresentation $g.(P_m\otimes V)\subset g.P_{m+1}$ is equal to $g.P_m\otimes V^g\subset g.P_{m+1}$ and the subrepresentation $\phi_{m+1,g}^{-1}(g.P_m\otimes V^g)\subset P_{m+1}$ is equal to $P_m\otimes g.V\subset P_{m+1}$.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%  The first equality is immediate from the definitions.
%  The second equality also follows from the definitions by observing that $\phi_{m+1,g}(P_m\otimes g.V)=g.P_m\otimes V^g$.
%\end{proof}

%Any subrepresentation $E\subset P_{m+1}^V$ corresponds by taking pullbacks to a chain of inclusions $P_m\otimes V\subset\tilde E\subset P_{m+1}$.
Write $\Ind(K(n),d)$ for the set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable representations of $K(n)$ of dimension $d$ for $d\in\NN^{K(n)_0}$. As the $\GL_n(\CC)$-action commutes with the natural base change action, we can define a $\GL_n(\CC)$-action on $\Ind(K(n),d)$.
\begin{proposition} \label{indecomposables}
  Let $m\geq 1$ and $d(m,r)=\dim P_{m+1}-r\dim P_m$ with $0\leq r\leq n-1$. The action of $\GL_n(\CC)$ is transitive on $\mathrm{Ind}(K(n),d(m,r))$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  For $m=1$, the action of $\GL_n(\CC)$ on $\Gr_d(\CC^n)$ is transitive which shows that it is transitive on $\Ind_{d(1,r)}(K(n))$.
  As the reflection functors preserve indecomposability and isomorphism classes, by Lemma~\ref{compatibleGSigma}, for every $g\in\GL_n(\CC)$, we obtain a commutative diagram
  \[\xymatrix{\Ind(K(n),d(m,r))\ar[r]^{\Sigma_2}\ar[d]^{g^{-T}}&\Ind(K(n),d(m+1,r))\ar[d]^g\\
    \Ind(K(n),d(m,r))\ar[r]^{\Sigma_2}&\Ind(K(n),d(m+1,r))}.\]
  As the $\GL_n(\CC)$-action is transitive on the left hand side, this implies that it is also transitive on the right hand side.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}\label{thm:truncpp}
  Fix a dimension vector $\bfe$.
  The quiver Grassmannian $\Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^V)$ is smooth for each $V\in \Gr(H_m)$.
  Moreover, for $V,W\in \Gr_d(H_m)$, we have $\Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^V)\cong \Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^W)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $g\in\GL_n(\CC)$.
  We first show that $\Gr_\bfe(g.P_{m+1}^V)=\Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^V)$.
  Assume that $P_{m+1}^V$ is given by the linear maps $M_{\alpha_i}$.
  Then $g.P_{m+1}^V$ is given by the matrices $(g.M)_{\alpha_i}=\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}M_{\alpha_j}$.
  Let $(U_1,U_2)\in\Gr_\bfe(g.P_{m+1}^V)$.
  Then we have  
  \[M_{\alpha_i}(U_2)\subset U_1 \text{ for all } i=1,\ldots,n\Leftrightarrow \left(\sum\limits_{j=1}^n g_{ij}M_{\alpha_j}\right)(U_2)\subset U_1 \text{ for all } i=1,\ldots,n.\]
  Note that we have $g^{-1}.(g.P_{m+1}^V)=P_{m+1}^V$ which shows the non-obvious direction.

  Proposition~\ref{pro:indecomposables} and~\ref{indecomposables} imply that all quiver Grassmannians $\Gr_\bfe(M)$ for a fixed $\bfe\in\NN^{Q_0}$ where $M\in\Ind(K(n),\udim P_{m+1}^V)$ are isomorphic.
  With other words we use that all indecomposables are truncated preprojectives.

  As the indecomposables form a dense open subset of all representations, we found a dense subset whose quiver Grassmannians for a fixed $\bfe$ are isomorphic.
  But now the same proof as for exceptional roots applies in order to show that these quiver Grassmannians need to be smooth, see \cite[Corollary 4]{cr}.
 % \footnote{The proof using moduli spaces needs to be written}
  %Both claims are proven via the same geometric construction.
  %For each dimension vector $\bfe$, there is a smooth variety
  %\[X_{\bfe,m}=\{(\tilde E,V):V\in \Gr_d(H_m),\ P_m\otimes V\subset\tilde E\subset P_{m+1}i,\ \udim\tilde E=\bfe+d\udim P_m\}.\]
  %Under the natural projection $\pi:X_{\bfe,m}\to \Gr_d(H_m)$, the fiber $\pi^{-1}(V)$ identifies with $\Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^V)$.
  %In particular, this implies $\Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^V)$ is smooth for each $V\in \Gr_d(H_m)$.
  %The variety $X_{\bfe,m}$ supports an action of $GL_n(\CC)$ by setting $g.(\tilde E,V)=\big(\phi_{m+1,g}^{-1}(g.\tilde E),g.V\big)$.
  %Indeed, by Lemma~\ref{le:g equalities} we have 
  %\[P_m\otimes g.V=\phi_{m+1,g}^{-1}(g.P_m\otimes V^g)=\phi_{m+1,g}^{-1}\big(g.(P_m\otimes V)\big)\subset\phi_{m+1,g}^{-1}(g.\tilde E).\]
  %Observe that the projection map $\pi$ is $GL_n(\CC)$-equivariant and thus by Lemma~\ref{le:transitivity} the quiver Grassmannians $\Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^V)$ and $\Gr_\bfe(P_{m+1}^W)$ are isomorphic for any $V,W\in \Gr_d(H_m)$.
\end{proof}


%\begin{lemma}
%  For any $m\ge1$, we have 
%  \[\dim\Hom(P_m,P_m)=1,\quad \dim\Hom(P_m,P_{m+1})=n,\quad \dim\Hom(P_{m+1},P_m)=0, \quad\dim\Ext(P_{m+1},P_m)=0.\]  
%  Moreover, for $1\le k<n$ and linearly independent functions $f_1,\ldots,f_k\in\Hom(P_m,P_{m+1})$, the map $[f_1\ \cdots\ f_k]:P_m^k\to P_{m+1}$ is injective. 
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof} 
%  Note that we have an Auslander-Reiten sequence
%  \begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:AR sequence}
%    0\longrightarrow P_{m-1}\stackrel{\iota_{m-1}}{\longrightarrow} P_m^n\stackrel{[f_1\ \cdots\ f_n]}{\longrightarrow} P_{m+1}\longrightarrow 0
%  \end{equation}
%  with irreducible homomorphisms $f_i$ which are also linearly independent. 
%  Thus they do not factor through a representation $Z\neq P_{m}$ which already means that they are injective, see for instance \cite[Lemma 1.6]{ass}. 
%  If we pick $k<n$ linearly independent homomorphisms $f_{i_1},\ldots, f_{i_k}$, this also means that $[f_{i_1}\ \cdots\ f_{i_k}]:P_m^k\to P_{m+1}$ is injective. 
%  Indeed otherwise, at least one of the homomorphisms would be forced to factor through a representation $Z\neq P_{m}$.
%\end{proof}
%\begin{remark}
%  Fix a basis $\{f_{m,1},\ldots,f_{m,n}\}$ for $\Hom(P_m,P_{m+1})$, $m\ge2$.
%  Define a basis $\{f_{\ell,1},\ldots,f_{\ell,n}\}$ for each $\Hom(P_\ell,P_{\ell+1})$, $1\le\ell\le m-1$, by downward induction as follows.  
%  Write $\iota_\ell:P_\ell\to P_{\ell+1}^n$ for the left-hand morphism from the sequence \eqref{eq:AR sequence} computed using $f_k=f_{\ell+1,k}$, $1\le k\le n$. 
%  Then the basis element $f_{\ell,k}$ is given by composing $\iota_\ell$ with the coordinate projection $\pi_k:P_{\ell+1}^n\to P_{\ell+1}$ onto the $k$-th factor.
%  Indeed, applying $\Hom(-,P_{\ell+1})$ to this sequence \eqref{eq:AR sequence} gives an isomorphism $\Hom(P_{\ell+1}^n,P_{\ell+1})\cong\Hom(P_\ell,P_{\ell+1})$ whereby the natural basis of coordinate projections on the left is taken to the basis $\{f_{\ell,k}\}$ on the right.
%\end{remark}

\subsection{Fibrations of Quiver Grassmannians}
\label{sec:fibrations}
Let $\ses{M}{B}{N}$ be a short exact sequence of representations.
This induces the so-called ``Caldero-Chapoton map'' between quiver Grassmannians
\[\Psi_\tbfe:\Gr_\tbfe(B)\to\bigsqcup_{\tbff+\tbfg=\tbfe}  \Gr_\tbff(M)\times \Gr_\tbfg(N),\,V\mapsto (V\cap M,(V+M)/M).\]
Following \cite[Section 3]{cc}, any nonempty fiber of $\Psi_\tbfe$ satisfies $\Psi^{-1}_\tbfe(U,W)=\mathbb{A}^{\dim\Hom(W,M/U)}$.

Let $\cG_{\tbff,\tbfg}:=\Psi^{-1}_\tbfe(\Gr_\tbff(M)\times \Gr_\tbfg(N))$. Then we have
$$\Gr_\tbfe(B)=\bigsqcup_{\tbff+\tbfg=\tbfe} \cG_{\tbff,\tbfg}.$$
The map $\Psi_\tbfe$ restricts to morphisms of projective varieties
\[\Psi_\tbfe^{\tbff,\tbfg}:\cG_{\tbff,\tbfg}\to \Gr_\tbff(M)\times \Gr_\tbfg(N).\]
The following is proved in \cite[Section 3]{cefr}.
\begin{theorem}
  \label{vb}
  If the fiber dimension of $\Psi_\tbfe^{\tbff,\tbfg}$ is constant over $\mathrm{Im}(\Psi_\tbfe^{\tbff,\tbfg})$, then it is an affine bundle over the image.
  In particular, the existence of a cell decomposition of $\mathrm{Im}(\Psi_\tbfe^{\tbff,\tbfg})$ implies a cell decomposition of $\cG_{\tbff,\tbfg}$ in this case.
\end{theorem}
%\begin{proof}\footnote{sketch, double-check}
%As $X$ and $Y$ are projective, they are compact. As the fibers are affine spaces of constant dimension and as $X$ and $Y$ are smooth, the induced morphism on the tangent spaces is surjective for all points $x\in X$. This shows that $f$ is smooth of relative dimension $n$, see Hartshorne and thus a submersion?!
%\end{proof}

We will apply this result in the setting of the truncated preprojective lifts from Lemma~\ref{le:homdecomposition}.
Fix $m\ge1$.
For subsets $J\subsetneq I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$ with $I\setminus J=\{j\}$, Lemma~\ref{le:properties}.(1) provides a short exact sequence 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:truncated ses}
  \ses{\tilde P_{m,j}}{\tilde P_{m+1}^J}{\tilde P_{m+1}^I}
\end{equation}
which induces a map between quiver Grassmannians as above:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:truncated CC}
  \Psi_{m+1,I,j}:\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m+1}^J)\to\bigsqcup_{\tbff+\tbfg=\tbfe} \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(\tilde P_{m,j})\times\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m+1}^I).
\end{equation}
To understand the fibers of this map for $m\ge2$, we will need to make use of another map between quiver Grassmannians coming out of Lemma~\ref{le:special subrepresentations}.
Here we consider the short exact sequence 
\[\ses{\tilde P_m(I,j)}{\tilde P_{m,j}}{\tilde K_m},\]
where $\tilde K_m=\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^I$ for $m\ge3$ and $\tilde K_2$ is the representation in \eqref{eq:special case} from Remark~\ref{rem:special case}.
Then in the same way as above we obtain the map
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:truncated CC2}
  \Phi_{m,I,j}:\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m,j})\to\bigsqcup_{\tbff+\tbfg=\tbfe} \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(\tilde P_m(I,j))\times\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde K_m).
\end{equation}
\begin{proposition}
  \label{quotient}
  For $m\geq 2$ and a nonempty subset $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
  The following hold for any $j\in I$:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The fiber $\Psi_{m+1,I,j}^{-1}(U,\tilde P_{m+1}^I)$ is not empty if and only if $\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j}/U)=0$.
    \item The fiber $\Psi_{m+1,I,j}^{-1}(U,\tilde P_{m+1}^I)$ is empty if and only if $\Phi_{m,I,j}(U)=(U,0)$, i.e.\ $U$ is already a subrepresentation of $\tilde P_m(I,j)$.
  \end{enumerate} 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Any subrepresentation $U\subset\tilde P_{m,j}$ produces an exact sequence
  \[\xymatrix{\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,U)\ar[r] &\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j})\ar[r] &\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j}/U)\ar[r] & 0}.\]
  But note that the fiber $\Psi_{m+1,I,j}^{-1}(U,\tilde P_{m+1}^I)$ being nonempty gives rise to a pushout diagram
  \[\xymatrix{0\ar[r]& U\ar[r]\ar[d]\ar@{}[dr]|(.3){\ulcorner} & U'\ar[d]\ar[r]& \tilde P_{m+1}^I\ar[r]\ar@{=}[d]& 0\\
    0\ar[r] &\tilde P_{m,j}\ar[r] &  \tilde P_{m+1}^J\ar[r] & \tilde P_{m+1}^I\ar[r] & 0}\]
  in which the bottom row is not split by Lemma~\ref{le:properties}.(4).
  This implies that the map 
  \[\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,U)\to\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j})\cong\CC\]
  is surjective and thus $\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j}/U)=0$.
  This argument can be reversed and thus (1) holds.
  
  Now consider $U\subset\tilde P_{m,j}$ with $U\in\Phi_{m,I,j}^{-1}(V,W)$.
  This gives rise to the following commutative diagram:  
  \[\xymatrix{
    0\ar[r] &\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,V)\ar[r]\ar[d] &\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,U)\ar[r]\ar[d] &\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,W)\ar[r]\ar[d] & 0\\
    0\ar[r] &\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_m(I,j))\ar[r]\ar[d] &  \Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j})\ar[r]\ar[d] & \Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde K_m)\ar[r]\ar[d] & 0\\
    0\ar[r] &\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_m(I,j)/V)\ar[r]\ar[d] &\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j}/U)\ar[r]\ar[d] &\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde K_m/W)\ar[r]\ar[d] & 0 \\
    &0&0&0&}\]
  By Corollary~\ref{cor:perpendicular}, we have $\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_m(I,j))=0$ and so $\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_m(I,j)/V)=0$ as well.
  This yields the isomorphisms
  \[\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j})\cong\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde K_m)\quad\text{and}\quad\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j}/U)\cong\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde K_m/W).\]

  If $W=0$, we get an isomorphism $\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j}/U)\cong\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j})\cong\CC$ and by part (1) we must have an empty fiber $\Psi_{m+1,I,j}^{-1}(U,\tilde P_{m+1}^I)=\varnothing$.

  If $W\neq 0$, $\tilde K_m/W$ is a proper factor of $\tilde K_m$ and we must have $\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde K_m/W)=0$.
  Indeed, by Auslander-Reiten theory every non-split morphism $g:\tilde K_m\to\tilde K_m/W$ factors through the middle term $Z$ of the AR-sequence 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ar2}
    \ses{\tilde K_m}{Z}{\tilde P_{m+1}^I}.
  \end{equation}
  This in particular says the first map of the induced sequence
  \[\Hom(\tilde K_m,\tilde K_m/W)\to\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde K_m/W)\to\Ext(Z,\tilde K_m/W)\]
  is zero.
  By Lemma~\ref{le:properties}.(4) and the Auslander-Reiten formulas, we have 
  \[\Ext(\tilde K_m,\tilde K_m)=0,\quad \Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde K_m)=\CC.\]
  For $m=2$, the identities above follow immediately from the corresponding statements for $\tau\tilde P_3^I$.
  Thus the injective map $\CC=\Hom(\tilde K_m,\tilde K_m)\to\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde K_m)$ induced by the Auslander-Reiten sequence \eqref{eq:ar2} is actually bijective and so applying $\Hom(-,\tilde K_m)$ to this sequence yields $\Ext(Z,\tilde K_m)=0$.
  But then $\Ext(Z,\tilde K_m/W)=0$ and so $\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde P_{m,j}/U)\cong\Ext(\tilde P_{m+1}^I,\tilde K_m/W)$ must be zero as well.
  By part (1) we see that the fiber $\Psi_{m+1,I,j}^{-1}(U,\tilde P_{m+1}^I)$ is nonempty in this case.
\end{proof}

Now we are able to state the following result concerning the fibers of $\Psi_{m+1,I,j}$:
\begin{proposition}
  \label{fibers}
  The following hold:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For $W\subsetneq\tilde P_{m+1}^I$ and $U\subseteq\tilde P_{m,j}$, we have $\Psi_{m+1,I,j}^{-1}(U,W)=\AA^{\langle W,\tilde P_{m,j}/U\rangle}$.
    \item If $W=\tilde P_{m+1}^I$, the fiber $\Psi_{m+1,I,j}^{-1}(U,W)$ is not empty if and only if $\Phi_{m,I,j}(U)\neq(U,0)$.
      In this case, we have $\Psi_{m+1,I,j}^{-1}(U,W)=\AA^{\langle W,\tilde P_{m,j}/U\rangle}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  By Lemma~\ref{le:subrep}, any subrepresentation $W\subsetneq\tilde P_{m+1}^I$ is preprojective.
  But the representation $\tilde P_{m,j}/U$ is not preprojective as it is a proper quotient of a preprojective representation unless $U=0$.
  Thus we have $\Ext(W,\tilde P_{m,j}/U)=0$. 
  If $U=0$, we have $\Ext(W,\tilde P_{m,j})=0$ because for dimension reasons every indecomposable direct summand of $W$ is isomorphic to a lift of some $P_l$ with $l\leq m$ and, moreover, $\Ext(P_l,P_m)=0$ for $l\leq m+1$.

  The second statement follows directly from Proposition~\ref{quotient}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{cellscover}
  For $m\geq 1$ and $I\subsetneq\{1,\ldots,n\}$, every quiver Grassmannian $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m+1}^I)$ admits a cell decomposition into affine spaces.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  We work by induction on $m$.
  When $m=1$, the claim is trivial since all quiver Grassmannians are points in this case.
  We establish the result for $m\ge2$ by proving the following more general statement:\\

  \noindent{\bf Claim.}
  For any admissible sequence $\bfI=(I_0,\ldots,I_k)$ with $k<m$ and any subset $J\subset I_0$, the quiver Grassmannian $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m+1}^J)$ admits a decomposition into affine spaces which is compatible with the unique map $\pi_{m+1}^{J,\bfI}:\tilde P_{m+1}^J\to\tilde P_{m+1}^\bfI$ from Lemma~\ref{le:truncated quotients} in the following sense:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[($\dagger$)] For any $V\in\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m+1}^J)$ such that $\pi_{m+1}^{J,\bfI}(V)\neq 0$, we have $\pi_{m+1}^{J,\bfI}(V')\neq 0$ for all $V'\in C_V$, where $C_V$ is the affine cell which contains $V$.
  \end{itemize}
  \vs
  
  In what follows, we will freely use the notation from Lemma~\ref{le:truncated quotients}.
  We proceed by simultaneous induction on $m$ and reverse induction on $|J|$.
  Fix an admissible sequence $\bfI=(I_0,\ldots,I_k)$ with $k<m$ and $J\subset I_0$.

  To begin, we assume $|J|=n-1$ and thus $J=I_0$.
  This gives $\tilde P_{m+1}^J\cong\tilde P_{m,i_0}^{J_0}$ and so by induction on $m$ the quiver Grassmannian $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m+1}^J)=\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m,i_0}^{J_0})$ admits a decomposition into affine spaces so that the compatibility condition ($\dagger$) holds for the unique map $\pi_{m,i_0}^{J_0,\delta\bfI}:\tilde P_{m,i_0}^{J_0}\to\tilde P_{m,i_0}^{\delta\bfI}$.
  But $\tilde P_{m,i_0}^{\delta\bfI}=\tilde P_{m+1}^\bfI$ so that $\pi_{m,i_0}^{J_0,\delta\bfI}$ coincides with the map $\pi_{m+1}^{J,\bfI}$ and thus the condition ($\dagger$) holds for the cell decomposition of $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m+1}^J)$.

  Now suppose $|J|<n-1$.
  If $J=I_0$, then we must have $k=0$ and $\tilde P_{m+1}^J=\tilde P_{m+1}^\bfI$ so that the compatibility condition ($\dagger$) with the map $\pi_{m+1}^{J,\bfI}$ is vacuous.\sayT{if $J=I_0$ we have $|J|=n-1$?}
  Thus we may assume $J\subsetneq I_0$.
  
  Choose any subset $I\subset I_0$ with $J\subset I$ and $|I\setminus J|=1$, say $I\setminus J=\{j\}$.
  This gives the short exact sequence \eqref{eq:truncated ses} inducing the maps $\Psi_{m+1,I,j}$ and $\Phi_{m,I,j}$ between quiver Grassmannians from \eqref{eq:truncated CC} and \eqref{eq:truncated CC2}.
  Then by induction on $|I|$, each quiver Grassmannian $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m+1}^I)$ has a decomposition into affine spaces which is compatible with $\pi_{m+1}^{I,\bfI}$, say 
  \[\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m+1}^I)=\coprod_{k=1}^r C_k.\]

  When $m=2$, each quiver Grassmannian $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(\tilde P_{m,j})$ is just a point.
  For $m\ge3$, each quiver Grassmannian $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(\tilde P_{m,j})$ admits a decomposition into affine spaces which is compatible with the map $\pi_{m,j}^\bfJ:\tilde P_{m,j}\to\tilde P_{m-1,(j,j)}^I$, where $\bfJ=(\{1,\ldots,\widehat j,\ldots,n\},I)$, say
  \[\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(\tilde P_{m,j})=\coprod_{\ell=1}^s B_\ell.\] 
  For $m=2$, we write $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(\tilde P_{m,j})=B_1$.

  When $\tbfg=\udim\tilde P_{m+1}^I$, Proposition~\ref{fibers} shows that the fibers of $\Psi_{m+1,I,j}$ over $B_\ell\times\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m+1}^I)$ are empty exactly when 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $m=2$ with $\tbff_{(2,\alpha_j^{-1})}\ne0$ or $\tbff_{(1,e)}\ne0$;
    \item $m\ge3$, with $\pi_{m,j}^\bfJ(U)=0$ for all $U\in B_\ell$.
  \end{itemize}
  When the fibers of $\Psi_{m+1,I,j}$ are not empty, for $1\le k\le r$ we obtain an affine cell in $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m+1}^J)$ of the form $B_\ell\times C_k\times\AA^d$ with~$d=\langle\tbfg,\udim\tilde P_{m,j}-\tbff\rangle$.
  For $V\in\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m+1}^J)$ which is contained in such a cell, we have $\pi_{m+1}^{J,I}(V)\in C_k$.
  But then $\pi_{m+1}^{J,\bfI}(V)\ne0$ if and only if $\pi_{m+1}^{I,\bfI}(W)\ne0$ for all $W\in C_k$ and thus $\pi_{m+1}^{J,\bfI}(V')\ne0$ for all $V'$ in this cell $B_\ell\times C_k\times\AA^d$ of $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m+1}^J)$.
\begin{comment}
\noindent {\bf Claim.} Let ${\bf j}=(\underline{j_1},\ldots,\underline{j_r})$ with $r\geq 1$ be an arbitrary admissible sequence and $\underline{j_1}=(\uj,j_{1,l+1},\ldots,j_{1,n-1})\in I_{n-1}$. The quiver Grassmannian $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ has a cell decomposition into affine spaces which is compatible with $\pi_{m,\uj}^{\bf j}$  in the following way: 
 Let $U\in\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ such that $\pi_m^{\bf j}(U)\neq 0.$
Then we have $\pi_{m,\uj}^{\bf j}(U')\neq 0$ for all $U'\in C_U$ where $C_U$ is the cell which contains $U$.
\vs


We proceed by induction on $m$ and reverse (?) induction on $l$. Let $\uj'=(j_1,\ldots,j_{l-1})$. If $m=1$ or $m=2$, the statement is straightforward for arbitrary $l$ as all quiver Grassmannians are points.
For general $m$, we consider the short exact sequence $$\sesm{\tilde P_{m-1,j_l}}{\tilde P_{m}^{\uj'}}{\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}}{\pi^{j_l}_{m,\uj'}}$$ which induces a map between quiver Grassmannians
$$\Psi_{m,\uj}:\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj'})\to\bigsqcup_{\tbff+\tbfg=\tbfe} \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff( \tilde P_{m-1,j_l})\times \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}).$$
It is important that we can choose $j_l$ arbitrarily with respect to the condition $j_l\neq j_1,\ldots, j_{l-1}$. Moreover, we consider the short exact sequence
$$\sesm{P(m,\uj)}{\tilde P_{m-1,j_l}}{\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}}{\pi^{\bf i}_m}$$
where
$${\bf i}=((1,\ldots,j_l-1,\widehat{j_l},j_l+1,\ldots,n),(j_1,\ldots,j_{l-1}))$$
and $\tau\tilde P_{m}^{\uj} =\tilde P^{\uj}_{m-2}=\tilde P_{m-2}^{\bf i}$ together with the induced map on quiver Grassmannians $\Phi_{m,\uj}$.

By induction hypothesis the quiver Grassmannians $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff( \tilde P_{m-1,j_l})$ have cell decompositions which are compatible with $\pi^{\bf i}_m$ and, moreover, the quiver Grassmannians $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ have a cell decompositions which are compatible with $\pi^{\bf j}_{m,\uj}$. The second part of Proposition~\ref{fibers} says that the fibers are empty if and only if $\pi^{\bf i}_m=0$ and $\tbfg=\udim \tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}$. This yields a collection of cells over which the fibers are empty. Note that $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ is just a point in this case.

If $\tbfg\neq \udim\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}$, by Proposition~\ref{fibers}, the fiber dimension only depends on the dimension vectors $\tbff, \tbfg$ which means that they are constant over the cells of $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(P_{m-1,j_l})\times \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$. In particular, they are constant over cells whose subrepresentations $U\in \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(P_{m-1,i_k})$ satisfy $\pi_m^{\bf i}(U)\neq 0$, but also over those whose subrepresentations $U\in \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(P_{m-1,i_k})$ satisfy $\pi_m^{\bf i}(U)= 0$. By Theorem~\ref{vb}, it follows that $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj'})$ has a cell decomposition.

Thus it remains to show that this cell decomposition of $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj'})$ is compatible with $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{\bf j}$ where ${\bf j}=(\underline{j_1},\underline{j_2},\ldots,\underline{j_r})$ with $\underline{j_1}=(\uj',j_{1,l},\ldots,j_{1,n-1})\in I_{n-1}$ and $j_{1,l}=j_l$. Recall that we have $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{\bf j}=\pi_{m,\uj}^{\bf j}\circ\pi_{m,\uj'}^{j_l}$ by Lemma~\ref{le:truncated quotients}.(2).

Fix $\tbff$ and $\tbfg$ together with cell decompositions 
\[\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(P_{m-1,j_l})=\coprod_{i\in I} B_i,\quad \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})=\coprod_{k\in K} C_k\]
such that the cell decomposition of $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})$ is compatible with $\pi^{\bf j}_{m,\uj}$. To finish the prove, it suffices to show that the cell decomposition of for $\Gr_{\tbff+\tbfg}(\tilde P_m^{\uj'})$ is compatible with $\pi^{\bf j}_{m,\uj'}$ because every projection onto a truncated preprojective is of this shape and we did not impose any restrictions on ${\bf j}$. 

We distinguish the following cases
\begin{itemize}
\item $\tbfg =\udim \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}$.
\item $\tbfg \neq \udim \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}$ with cells $B_i$ and $C_k$ such that $\pi^{\bf j}_{m,\uj}(V)=0$ for all $V\in C_k$.
 \item $\tbfg \neq \udim \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}$ with cells $B_i$ and $C_k$ such that $\pi^{\bf j}_{m,\uj}(V)\neq 0$ for all $V\in C_k$.
 
\end{itemize}
In the first case, we have $\Gr_\tbfg(\tilde P_{m}^{\uj})=\{\pt\}$ and thus there exists a single cell $C_0=\mathbb{A}^0$. Fix a cell $B_i\subset\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(P_{m-1,j_l})$. As the cell decomposition of $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(P_{m-1,j_l})$ is compatible with $\pi_{m}^{\bf i}$, we either have that the fiber over $B_i\times C_0$ is empty or that the fiber is of constant dimension building a new cell $CB_i$. For all representations $U\in CB_i$ we have $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{\bf j'}(U)\neq 0$ because $\pi_{m,\uj}^{\bf j}$ is surjective and $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{j_l}(U)=\tilde P_{m}^{\uj}$.

In the second case, the fiber over $B_i\times C_k$ is non empty and of constant dimension building a new cell $CB_{i,k}$. As we have $\pi^{\bf j}_{m,\uj}(V)=0$ for all $V\in C_k$, it follows that $\pi^{\bf j'}_{m,\uj'}(U)=0$ for all representations $U\in (CB)_{i,k}$.

In the third case, an analogous argument shows that $\pi^{\bf j'}_{m,\uj'}(U)\neq 0$ for all $U\in (CB)_{i,k}$.

%Thus let $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{\bf j'}(U)= 0$ with $U\subset \tilde P_{m}^{\uj'}$. Then we either have $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{j_l}(U)=0$ which means that $U$ comes from a subrepresentation of $\tilde P_{m,j_l}$ and $\tbfg=0$. In this case, all representations in the cell of $U$ come from a subrepresentation of $\tilde P_{m,j_l}$. Thus assume that $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{j_l}(U)\neq 0$. We have $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{j_l}(U)\neq \tilde P_{m}^{\uj}$ because otherwise we had $\pi_{m,\uj'}^{\bf j'}(U)\neq 0$. Apply induction hypothesis now.


We proceed by induction and combine the two maps $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$ and obtain a map
\[\Psi:\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k-1)})\to\bigsqcup_{\tbff+\tbfg+\tbfh=\tbfe} \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff( P(m,k))\times \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)})\times \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfh(\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}).\]

By Lemma~\ref{directsums} and induction hypothesis every quiver Grassmannian on the right hand side has a cell decomposition. The second part of the Proposition says that the fibers are empty if and only if $\tbfg=0$ and $\tbfh=\udim \tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)}$. In all other cases, the fiber dimension only depend on the dimension vectors $\tbff, \tbfg,\tbfh$ which means that they are constant over $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff( P(m,k))\times \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)})\times \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfh(\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k)})$\footnote{actually this should already say that this is a vector bundle as the base space is smooth (all reps are exceptional), apply Lemma~\ref{vb}?}. Analogously to Lemma~\ref{directsums}, we can conclude that this induces trivial bundles over every affine cell. In total, this yields a cell decomposition of the quiver Grassmannian $\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P_{m+1}^{(k-1)})$.
\end{comment}
\end{proof}


%Note that we can also consider 
%$\Psi_1:\Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfe(\tilde P^{(k-1)}_{m})\to\bigsqcup_{\tbff+\tbfg=\tbfe} \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbff(\bigoplus_{i=1}^{k}\tilde P_{m-1,i})\times \Gr^{\tilde Q}_\tbfg(\tilde P_m^{(k)})$ where $\tilde P_m^{(n-1)}=\tilde P_{m-1}^{(1)}$ (up to renumbering the arrows). But then one needs to adjust $\Psi_2$ because the factor of $\bigoplus_{i=1}^{k}\tilde P_{m-1,i}$ were $(\tau\tilde P_m^{(k)})^k$.


\begin{theorem}\label{celldec}The following holds:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every quiver Grassmannian of any indecomposable preprojective or preinjective representation of $K(n)$ and $\widetilde{K(n)}$ has a cell decomposition into affine spaces.
\item Let $X\in\rep K(n)$ be an indecomposable representation of dimension $(d,e)$ or $(e,d)$ where $(d,e)=\udim P_m-r\udim P_{m-1}$ for $m\geq 2$ and $\leq 0\leq r\leq n-1$. Then every quiver Grassmannian $\Gr_{\bfe}(X)$ has a cell decomposition into affine spaces.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The first part follows by combining the results of Section~\ref{torusaction} and Theorems~\ref{thm:bb} and~\ref{cellscover} taking into account that every preprojective representation of $\widetilde{ K(n)}$ is a lift of a preprojective representation which can be proven using the same argument as in the proof of Lemma~\ref{le:lifts of transjectives}. The dual version for preinjective representations follows as $\Gr_{\bfe}(P_m)\cong \Gr_{\udim P_m-\bfe}(I_m)$ and $\Gr_{\tbfe}(\tilde P_m)\cong\Gr_{\udim \tilde P_m-\tbfe}(\tilde I_m)$ respectively.

The second part follows in the same way, additionally, taking Theorem~\ref{thm:truncpp} into account.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Let $X\in\rep K(n)$ be a direct sum of exceptional representations. Then every quiver Grassmannian $\Gr_{\bfe}(X)$ has a cell decomposition into affine spaces. In particular, this is true for all rigid representations of $K(n)$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
As every exceptional representation of $K(n)$ is either preprojective or preinjective, we have
$$X=\bigoplus_{i=1}^rP_{j_i}\oplus\bigoplus_{i=1}^sI_{k_i}$$
where we assume that $j_i\leq j_{i+1}$ and write
$$P(r'):=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{r'} P_{j_i},\quad I(s'):=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{s'}I_{k_i}$$ 
for $r'\leq r$ and $s'\leq s$. 

By Theorem~\ref{celldec}, the claim is true for all quiver Grassmannians attached to $P_{j_i}$ or $I_{k_i}$. Consider the short exact sequence
\[\ses{P_{j_{r'+1}}}{P(r'+1)}{P(r')}.\]
By induction, we can assume that all quiver Grassmannians attached to the two outer terms have a cell decomposition into affine spaces. Consider the Caldero-Chapoton map
\[\Psi_\bfe:\Gr_\bfe(P(r'+1))\to\bigsqcup_{\bff+\bfg=\bfe} \Gr_\bff(P_{j_{r'+1}})\times \Gr_\bfg(P(r')).\]
The results of \cite[Section 3]{cc} show that $\Psi_{\tbfe}^{-1}(U,V)=\AA^{\dim\Hom(V,P_{j_{r'+1}}/U)}$  for all $(U,V)\in \Gr_\bff(P_{j_{r'+1}})\times \Gr_\bfg(P(r'))$, in particular the fibre is never empty. Now every subrepresentation $V$ of $P(r')$ is isomorphic to direct sum of preprojective representations such that for each direct summand $P_l$ we have $l\leq j_{r'}$. Moreover, the quotient $P_{j_{r'+1}}/U$ is not projective if $U\neq 0$ and equal to $P_{j_{r'+1}}$ otherwise. Together this yields $\Ext(V,P_{j_{r'+1}}/U)=0$ and thus
$$\dim\Hom(V,P_{j_{r'+1}}/U)=\langle V, P_{j_{r'+1}}/U\rangle$$
for all $(U,V)\in \Gr_\bff(P_{j_{r'+1}})\times \Gr_\bfg(P(r'))$. By Theorem~\ref{vb}, this already shows that $\Gr_{\bfe}(P(r'))$ has a cell decomposition into affine spaces for every $1\leq r'\leq r$. By duality, the same is true for $\Gr_{\bfe}(I(s))$. 

Finally consider the short exact sequence
$$\ses{I(s)}{X}{P(r)}.$$
As every quotient of $I(s)$ is preinjective and as every subrepresentation of $P(r')$ is preprojective, the same argument shows that every quiver Grassmannian attached to $X$ has a cell decomposition into affine spaces
\end{proof}

As the $F$-polynomial of truncated preprojective representations only depend on the dimension vector, we may denote them by $F_{\udim P_m{(k)}}$. The description of the non-empty fibers in Proposition~\ref{fibers} together with Corollary~\ref{fpoly} and Theorem~\ref{celldec} yield the following:
\begin{corollary}
For $m\geq 2$ and $0\leq k\leq n-2$, we have 
$$F_{\udim P_m^{(k)}}=F_{\udim P_m^{(k+1)}}F_{\udim P_{m-1}}-x^{\udim P_{m}^{(k)}}F_{\udim P_{m-2}^{(k)}}.$$
\end{corollary}

\section{Combinatorial description of non-empty cells}
\noindent In this section, we provide two combinatorial descriptions of the non-empty cells in the quiver Grassmannians of (truncated) preprojective representations of $K(n)$.
The first is quiver theoretic and follows directly from the recursive construction of the cell decomposition in Section~\ref{sec:fibrations}.
The second is the notion of compatible pairs in a maximal Dyck path arising in the computation of rank 2 cluster variables \cite{llz}.
We give a bijection between these which provides a partial answer to a question of the first author \cite{rupel}.

\subsection{2-Quivers}

The key concept for describing the cell decompositions is the following notion of $2$-quiver which is closely related to certain coefficient quivers of the corresponding representations.
It will turn out that a feature of this construction is that it is blind to the coloring of the different arrows of $\widetilde K(n)$ covering the arrows of $K(n)$.
\begin{definition}
  Let $Q=(Q_0,Q_1)$ be a quiver.
  A subset $\beta\subset Q_0$ is \emph{successor closed in $Q$} if for each $p\in\beta$, the existence of an arrow $\alpha:p\to q$ in $Q_1$ implies $q\in\beta$.

  A \emph{2-arrow} of the quiver $Q$ is an ordered pair $V=\big(\Gamma(1),\Gamma(2)\big)$ of full connected subquivers of $Q$, these will be denoted $V:\Gamma(1)\to\Gamma(2)$.
  A \emph{2-quiver} is a pair $\cQ=(Q,Q_2)$ consisting of a quiver $Q$ and a collection $Q_2$ of 2-arrows of $Q$.
  Given a 2-quiver $\cQ$, we call a subset $\beta\subset Q_0$ \emph{strong successor closed in $\cQ$} if it is successor closed in $Q$ and for each 2-arrow $V:\Gamma(1)\to\Gamma(2)$ in $Q_2$ with $\Gamma(1)_0\subset\beta$ we have $\Gamma(2)_0\cap\beta\ne\varnothing$.  
\end{definition}

We introduce a notion of equivalence of $2$-quivers.
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:2equivalence}
  Let $\cQ=(Q,Q_2)$ be a $2$-quiver with a $2$-arrow $V:\Gamma(1)\to\Gamma(2)$ in $Q_2$ such that one of the following conditions is satisfied:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\Gamma(1)$ has precisely one source $p$; 
    \item $\Gamma(2)$ has precisely one sink $q$;
    \item $\Gamma(1)=\{p\}$ and $\Gamma(2)=\{q\}$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Depending on the condition which is satisfied, we define
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\cQ_p$ as the $2$-quiver obtained from $\cQ$ when replacing the $2$-arrow $V$ by a $2$-arrow $V_p:\{p\}\to\Gamma(2)$;
    \item $\cQ_q$ as the $2$-quiver obtained from $\cQ$ when replacing the $2$-arrow $V$ by a $2$-arrow $V_q:\Gamma(1)\to \{q\}$;
    \item $\cQ_V$ as the $2$-quiver obtained from $\cQ$ when replacing the $2$-arrow $V$ by a usual arrow $\alpha_V:p\to q$. 
  \end{enumerate}
  This defines a relation on the set of $2$-quivers denoted by $\cQ\to\cQ_p$, $\cQ\to\cQ_q$ and $\cQ\to\cQ_V$ respectively.
  Moreover, it induces an equivalence relation $\sim$ on the set of $2$-quivers when taking the symmetric and transitive closure of this relation. 
\end{definition}

Observe that the vertex sets of equivalent $2$-quivers coincide.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:2equivalence}
  Let $\cQ=(Q,Q_2)$ and $\cQ'=(Q',Q_2')$ be equivalent $2$-quivers.
  If $\beta\subset Q_0$ is strong successor closed in $\cQ$, it also defines a strong successor closed set of vertices in $\cQ$.
  In particular, the number of subsets of $Q_0$ which are strong successor closed in $\cQ$ coincides with the number of subsets of $Q_0'$ which are strong successor closed in $\cQ'$.
\end{lemma}

For the proof of this Lemma the following straightforward observation is essential: in a finite connected quiver which has precisely one source $p$, there exists a path from $p$ to every other vertex of the quiver.
An analogous statement holds if a quiver has precisely one sink. 

\begin{proof}
  By induction, we only need to consider the cases $\cQ'\in\{\cQ_p,\cQ_q,\cQ_V\}$ where one of the conditions of Definition~\ref{def:2equivalence} is satisfied.

  Assume first that $\cQ'\in\{\cQ_p,\cQ_q\}$.
  Then we have $Q=Q'$ from which we immediately see that $\beta\subset Q_0$ is successor closed in $Q$ if and only if $\beta$ is successor closed in $Q'$.
  We only consider the case $\cQ'=\cQ_p$ below, the argument for $\cQ'=\cQ_q$ is dual.

  Let $\beta\subset Q_0$ be strong successor closed in $\cQ$.
  To see that $\beta$ is strong successor closed in $\cQ_p$ it suffices to consider the 2-arrow $V_p:\{p\}\to\Gamma(2)$.
  Suppose $\{p\}\subset\beta$.
  As $\beta$ is successor closed in $Q$ and $p$ is a source in the connected quiver $\Gamma(1)$, we have $\Gamma(1)_0\subset\beta$ and thus $\Gamma(2)_0\cap\beta\ne\varnothing$, i.e.\ $\beta$ is strong successor closed in $\cQ_p$.
  The reverse implication is immediate since $\{p\}\subset\Gamma(1)_0$.

  Now assume $\cQ'=\cQ_V=\big(Q_V,(Q_V)_2\big)$. 
  Let $\beta\subset Q_0$ be strong successor closed in $\cQ$.
  Since $(Q_V)_2\subset Q_2$, to see that $\beta$ is strong successor closed in $\cQ_V$ we only need to show that $\beta$ is successor closed in $Q_V$.  
  For this it suffices to consider the arrow $\alpha_V:p\to q$ for which that claim is obvious since $p\in\beta$ is equivalent to $\{p\}\subset\beta$ and similarly for $q$.

  Finally, let $\beta\subset(Q_V)_0$ be strong sucessor closed in $\cQ_V$.
  Since $Q_1\subset(Q_V)_1$, we immediately see that $\beta$ is successor closed in $Q$.
  To see that $\beta$ is strong successor closed in $\cQ$, it suffices to consider the 2-arrow $V:\{p\}\to\{q\}$ for which the claim is obvious as above.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  We will usually apply Lemma~\ref{lem:2equivalence} below after performing each of the equivalences from Definition~\ref{def:2equivalence}.
  That is, given a 2-arrow $V:\Gamma(1)\to\Gamma(2)$ for which $\Gamma(1)$ has a unique source $p$ and $\Gamma(2)$ has a unique sink $q$, we get an equivalent 2-quiver by replacing this 2-arrow with a usual arrow $a_V:p\to q$.
\end{remark}

%The aim is to associate a $2$-quiver with every preprojective representation $P_m$ and with their quotients $P_m^{(k)}$ defined in section~\ref{QG}.
%These $2$-quivers are related to certain coefficient quivers of these representations.
%The upshot is that the non-empty cells of $\Gr_e(P_m)$ and $\Gr_e(P_m^{(k)})$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the strong successor closed subsets $\beta$ of type $e$.
%Hence the corresponding Euler characteristic can be computed when counting these subsets.
%It will turn out that a feature of this description is that it does not take care of the coloring of the different arrows induced by the arrows of $K(n)$.

%\begin{remark}\footnote{Insert a remark that we do not work on the universal cover} 
%  Lemma~\ref{AR} can be generalized to the cases $m\leq 2$.
%  The only technical problem is that $\tau \tilde P^{(k)}_{m+1}$ is no quotient of $\tilde P_{m,k}$ and we have to replace it by the image of the unique morphism to $\tau \tilde P^{(k)}_{m+1}$ which induces the exact sequence. 
%\end{remark}
In the following, we frequently use the notation and conventions of Section~\ref{Lifting}.
The next step is to associate a $2$-quiver $\cQ_{m+1}^{[k]}$ with the lifted truncated preprojective representations 
\[\tilde P_{m+1}^{[k]}:=
  \begin{cases}
    \tilde P_{m+1}^{\{n,n-1,\ldots,n-k+1\}} & \text{ if $m$ is odd;}\\
    \tilde P_{m+1}^{\{1,2,\ldots,k\}} & \text{ if $m$ is even;}
  \end{cases}\] 
for $m\geq 1$ and $0\leq k\leq n-1$.
When $k=0$ above, we take $\tilde P_{m+1}^{[0]}=\tilde P_{m+1}$.
We aim to construct $\cQ_{m+1}^{[k]}$ so that the strong successor closed subsets are in one-to-one correspondence with cells of quiver Grassmannians of $\tilde P_{m+1}^{[k]}$.

Recall that, by Theorem~\ref{celldec}, the cells of the quiver Grassmannians attached to $P_{m+1}^{[k]}:=G(\tilde P_{m+1}^{[k]})$ are in one-to-one correspondence with those attached to the lift $\tilde P_{m+1}^{[k]}$.
Moreover, by Theorem~\ref{thm:truncpp}, the quiver Grassmannians $\Gr_{\tbfe}(P_{m+1}^V)$ of arbitrary truncated preprojective representations $P_{m+1}^V$ only depend on $\tbfe$ and $\udim P_{m+1}^V$.
In short, the $2$-quivers $\mathcal Q_{m+1}^{[k]}$ should be viewed as being attached to any (truncated) preprojective representation of the appropriate dimension.

For building the mentioned $2$-quivers, we use the recursive construction described in Section~\ref{Lifting}.
The following remarks are meant to understand the structure of these $2$-quivers. 
\begin{remark}\mbox{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item It will turn out that every vertex of the quiver $\mathcal Q_{m+1}^{[k]}$ uniquely corresponds to a vertex of the universal covering quiver $\widetilde{K(n)}$, but that different vertices of $\cQ_{m+1}^{[k]}$ can correspond to the same vertex of $\widetilde{K(n)}$.
      Also every usual arrow of $\mathcal Q_m^{[k]}$ does correspond to an arrow of $\widetilde{K(n)}$ and thus to an arrow of $K(n)$. In particular, the quiver obtained from $\mathcal Q_m^{[k]}$ when forgetting the $2$-arrows gives rise to a (non-disjoint) union of subquivers of $\widetilde{K(n)}$.

\item Recall that the representation $\tilde P_2^{[n-1]}$ is defined by the support quiver
\[
  \tilde P_2^{[n-1]}=(1,\alpha_1)\xlongleftarrow{\alpha_1}(2,e).%=P_1^{(1)}=j^{(1)}_1\xlongleftarrow{v_1}i^{(1)}_1
\]

%In other words, $P_2^{(n-1)}$ is chosen as be the cokernel of a short exact sequence
%\[
%  \ses{ P_1^{n-1}}{ P_2}{P_2^{(n-1)}}.
%\]
Choosing the lifts $\tilde P_{1,i}$ of $P_1$ supported at $(1,\alpha_i)$ for $2\leq i\leq n$ and using the description of the $\Ext$-groups induced by (\ref{eq:maphomext}), we have 
\begin{align}\label{eq:case2}
  \Ext( P_2^{[n-1]},P_1)\cong \bigoplus_{i=2}^{n}\Ext(\tilde P_2^{[n-1]},\tilde P_{1,i})\cong\langle (2,1)\xrightarrow{\alpha_i}(1,\alpha_i)\mid i=2,\ldots,n\rangle.
\end{align}


\item  For $m\geq 3$, recall that we have $\dim\Hom(P_{m-1},\tau P_m^{[k]})=\dim\Ext(P_m^{[k]},P_{m-1})$ by the Auslander-Reiten formula. This induces isomorphisms
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:homext} 
  \bigoplus_{i=k+1}^n\Hom(\alpha_{i}^{(-1)^{m}}.\tilde P_{m-1},\tau\tilde P_{m}^{[k]})\cong\bigoplus_{i=k+1}^n\Ext(\tilde P_m^{[k]},\alpha_{i}^{(-1)^{m}}. \tilde P_{m-1})\cong \Ext(P_m^{[k]},P_{m-1}).
\end{align}
This means that we can choose a basis of $\Ext(P_m^{[k]},P_{m-1})$ which is compatible with the lifts to the universal covering and which gives a one-to-one correspondence between the basis elements of $\Ext(P_m^{[k]},P_{m-1})$ and $\Hom(P_{m-1},\tau P_m^{[k]})$. 
In view of Corollary~\ref{cor:perpendicular}, we have also an isomorphism $$\Ext(\tilde P_m^{[k]},\tilde P_{m-1,k})\cong\Ext(\tilde P_m^{[k]},\tau\tilde P_m^{[k]}).$$
These isomorphisms will also be present in the structure of the $2$-quivers $\cQ_m^{[k]}$. Finally note that there exists a short exact sequence
\[\ses{\Hom(P_{m-1},P_{m-1})}{\Ext(P_m^{[k]},P_{m-1})}{\Ext(P_m^{[k+1]},P_{m-1})}.\]
Thus a basis of $\Ext(P_m^{[k]},P_{m-1})$ can be obtained by taking the last $k$ basis elements of a basis of $\Ext(P_m^{[n-1]},P_{m-1})$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

%It turns out that all $2$-quivers can be built from the $2$-quivers of $\tilde P_1$, $\tilde P_2$ and $\tilde P_2^{[n-1]}$. 
Initially, the $2$-quiver $\mathcal Q_1=\cQ_1^{[0]}$ of $\tilde P_1$ is defined by the vertex $(1,e)$. Moreover, we define the translated $2$-quivers $\cQ_{1,i}$ by the vertices $(1,\alpha_i)$. Using (\ref{eq:case2}), we can recursively construct the (truncated) preprojective representation $\tilde P_{2}^{[k]}$ for $k=n-1,\ldots,0$ which are defined by the support quivers
\begin{align}
  \label{coeff}
    \xymatrix@R40pt@C10pt{&(2,e)\ar_{\alpha_1}[ld]\ar^{\alpha_{n-k}}[rd]&\\ (1,\alpha_1)&\cdots&(1,\alpha_{n-k})}
\end{align}

We define the $2$-quiver $\mathcal Q_{2}^{[k]}$  of $\tilde P_2^{[k]}$ for $k=n-1,\ldots,0$ by
\\

\begin{tikzpicture}
\tikzstyle{box} = [rectangle, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=1cm, text centered, draw=black]

\draw[->,red] (Q3)--(A) node[pos=.5,above] {\footnotesize$\alpha_{n-k}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\\

\noindent
where the $2$-arrows are colored red.
Note that the vertices $(1,\alpha_i)$ are just the $2$-quivers $\cQ_{1,i}$ corresponding to $\tilde P_{1,i}$.
The $2$-quiver $\mathcal Q_2^{[k]}$ is clearly equivalent to the support quiver (\ref{coeff}) thought of as a 2-quiver with no 2-arrows.
In abuse of notation, we also denote the support quiver by $\mathcal Q_{2}^{[k]}$. In order to keep the illustrations and combinatorics simple, we will work with this quiver instead. We also define the translated two quiver $\cQ_{2,i}$ as those obtained from $\cQ_{2}$ by translating all vertices and ($2$-)arrows by $\alpha_i^{-1}$.

The next step is to define the $2$-quivers $\cQ^{[k]}_3$ of the (truncated) preprojective lifts $\tilde P^{[k]}_3$ whence the remaining $2$-quivers attached to the (truncated) preprojectives $\tilde P_m^{[k]}$ can be obtained recursively. First, we define
$$\cQ_3^{[n-1]}:=\alpha_{n}^{-1}.\cQ_2^{[1]},$$
i.e. we translate all vertices - understood as vertices of $\widetilde{K(n)}$ - and $(2)$-arrows by $\alpha_n^{-1}$. Now $\cQ_3^{[k]}$ can be found as a subquiver of $\cQ_{3}$ which is given by connecting $\cQ_3^{[n-1]}$ to $\cQ_{2,i}$ for $i=n-1,\ldots, 1$ in the following way: \\

\noindent In abuse of notation, we did not label the vertices in the illustration. Note that the middle vertex of $\mathcal Q_3^{[n-1]}$ corresponds to $(2,\alpha_n^{-1})$ and that all $2$-arrows, which are again colored red, end in a vertex corresponding to $(1,e)$ of $\widetilde{K(n)}$. We again define translated versions $\cQ_{3,i}:=\alpha_i.\cQ_3$ of $\cQ_3$ which again means that we translate $\cQ_{3}$ as a union subquiver contained in $\widetilde{K(n)}$.

\begin{remark} Recall that $\tilde P_3^{[n-1]}=\alpha_n^{-1}.\tilde P_2^{[1]}$. Moreover, (\ref{eq:homext}) for $m=3$ yields 
$$\Ext(P_2^{[1]},P_2)\cong\Ext(P_3^{[n-1]},P_2)\cong\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n-1}\Ext(\tilde P_3^{[n-1]},\alpha_i^{-1}\tilde P_2).$$
This decomposition induces a basis of $\Ext(P_3^{[n-1]},P_2)$, each basis element given by the linear map $$(2,\alpha_n^{-1})\xlongrightarrow{\alpha_n}(1,e)\in\Hom_{\CC}((\tilde P_2^{[1]})_{(2,\alpha_n^{-1})},(\alpha_i^{-1}\tilde P_2)_{(1,e)})$$
for $i=1,\ldots,n-1$. Recall that the representation $\tau\tilde P_3^{[k]}$ is given by 
\[ \xymatrix@R40pt@C10pt{&(1,e)&\\ (2,\alpha_1^{-1})\ar_{\alpha_1}[ru]&\cdots&(2,\alpha_{k}^{-1})\ar^{\alpha_{k}}[lu]}.\]
Note that the image of the homomorphism corresponding to the basis element spanning $$\Hom(\alpha_{k}^{(-1)}.\tilde P_{2},\tau\tilde P_{m}^{[k]})\cong\Ext(\tilde P_3^{[n-1]},\alpha_k^{-1}\tilde P_2)$$ corresponds to the subquiver $(2,\alpha_k^{-1})\xrightarrow{\alpha_k} (1,e)$. This translates to the fact that $\cQ_3^{[k]}$ is glued to the image of the homomorphism $\tilde P_{2,k}\to \tau \tilde P_3^{[k]}$ which is of dimension $(1,1)$. In view of Lemma~\ref{lem:2equivalence}, we forgo inserting the corresponding rectangles around the subquiver and just connect the $2$-arrows to the sinks of the corresponding subquivers of dimension $(1,1)$. 
%In summary, the chosen basis of $\Ext(P_3^{[n-1]},P_2)$ motivated the definition of the $2$-quiver $\mathcal Q_3=\mathcal Q_3^{[0]}$ of $\tilde P_3$ and the $2$-quivers $\mathcal Q_3^{[k]}$ for $k=n-1,\ldots,1$.
\end{remark}
%It remains to consider the case when $m$ is even. Lemma~\ref{AR} yields
%\begin{align}\label{eq:case2}
 %\Hom(P_{m-1},\tau \tilde P_{m}^{[k]})\cong\bigoplus_{i=k+1}^{n}\Hom(\alpha_i\tilde P_{m-1},\tau \tilde P_{m}^{[k]})\cong \bigoplus_{i=k+1}^{n}\Ext(\tilde P_m^{[k]},\alpha_i\tilde P_{m-1})\cong\Ext(P_m^{[k]},P_{m-1}).
%\end{align}
Now we can recursively build the $2$-quivers $\cQ_{m+1}^{[k]}$ of $\tilde P_{m+1}^{[k]}$ for $m\geq 3$ and $k=n-1,\ldots,0$. 
%This construction is motivated by considering the natural basis of $\Ext(P_m^{[n-1]},P_{m-1})$ induced by the decomposition (\ref{eq:homext}). 
%As we have a one-to-one correspondence between basis elements of $\Hom(P_{m-1},\tau P_m^{[k]})$ and $\Ext(P_m^{[k]},P_{m-1})$ when passing to the universal covering quiver, we can proceed as before.
%Recall that we have $\udim P_m^{[k]}=\udim P_{m-1}^{[1]}+(n-k-1)\udim P_{m-1}$.
Let us assume that we already constructed the $2$-quivers $\cQ_{l}^{[j]}$ of $P_{l}^{[j]}$ for $l\leq m$ and $j=0,\ldots, n-1$ and $l=m+1$ and $j=n-1,\ldots,k$. As before, we define the translated $2$-quivers $\cQ_{m,i}=\alpha_i^{(-1)^{m+1}}.\cQ_m$. Moreover, we define $$\cQ_{m+1}^{[n-1]}:=\begin{cases}\alpha_{n}^{(-1)}.\cQ_{m}^{[1]}\text{ if }m\text{ is even}\\\alpha_{1}.\cQ_{m}^{[1]}\text{ if }m\text{ is odd}\end{cases}.$$

For $m\geq 3$, the truncated preprojective $\tau\tilde P_{m+1}^{[k]}\cong\tilde P_{m-1}^{[k]}$ can uniquely be found as a quotient of $\tilde P_{m,k}$. This can also be seen on the level of $2$-quivers, i.e. we find $\cQ_{m-1}^{[k]}$ as a subquiver of $\cQ_{m,k}$.  More precisely, this subquiver can be found at the very right of the $2$-quiver $\mathcal Q_{m,k}$.  Now the $2$-quiver $\mathcal Q_{m+1}^{[k-1]}$ of $\tilde P^{[k-1]}_{m+1}$ is given by glueing the $2$-quiver $\mathcal Q_{m+1}^{[k]}$ to $\mathcal Q_{m,k}$ by a $2$-arrow. Thereby, the $2$-arrow connects $\mathcal Q_{m+1}^{[k]}$ to the subquiver $\cQ_{m-1}^{[k]}$ in $\cQ_{m,k}$. This gives the following $2$-quiver $\mathcal Q_{m+1}^{[k-1]}$:

\noindent 
%In order to keep the diagrams as simple as possible we did not insert the labels of the vertices. As every vertex  $q\in(\mathcal Q_m^{[k]})_0$ corresponds a vertex $\tilde q\in \widetilde{K(n)_0}$, in any case it is straightforward to associate an arrow $\alpha_i\in K(n)_1$ with every ($2$-)arrow of $\mathcal Q_m^{[k]}$. 
 As already mentioned two different vertices of $\mathcal Q_m^{[k]}$ can correspond to the same vertex of $\widetilde{K(n)}$. Writing dimension vectors $\tbfe\in\NN^{\widetilde{K(n)_0}}$ as $\tbfe=\sum_{q\in \widetilde{K(n)_0}}\tbfe_q\cdot q$, the dimension types $\tbfe (\beta)$ and  $\bfe (\beta)$ of a subset $\beta\subset (\mathcal Q_m^{[k]})_0$ are defined by
$$\tbfe (\beta)=\sum_{q\in\beta} \tilde q\in\NN^{\widetilde{K(n)_0}},\quad \bfe (\beta)=G_{K(n)}\tbfe (\beta)\in\NN^{K(n)_0}$$
where $\tilde q\in\widetilde{K(n)}_0$ is the vertex which corresponds to $q\in \beta\subset (\mathcal Q_m^{[k]})_0$.


\begin{theorem}\begin{enumerate}
\item  For $\tbfe\in\NN^{\widetilde{K(n)_0}}$, the Euler characteristic $\chi(\Gr_{\tbfe }(\tilde P_m^{[k]}))$ is given by the number of strong successor closed subsets of dimension type $\tbfe$ of the $2$-quiver of $\mathcal Q_m^{[k]}$.
	\item For $\bfe\in\NN^{K(n)_0}$, the Euler characteristic $\chi(\Gr_{\bfe }(P_m^{[k]}))$ is given by the number of strong successor closed subsets of dimension type $\bfe$ of the $2$-quiver of $\mathcal Q_m^{[k]}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The results of Section~\ref{QG} imply that the second statement follows from the first one.
We proceed by induction on $m$ and $k$. The case of the representation $\tilde P_1$ is trivial. We have $(\tilde P_2^{[k]})_q\in\{0,1\}$ for all $q\in\widetilde{K(n)}$, whence the  subrepresentations are in one-to-one correspondence with the successor closed subsets of the quiver (\ref{coeff}) which is equivalent to  $\mathcal Q_2^{[k]}$ . Equivalently, we have $\Gr_{\tbfe}(\tilde P_2^{[k]})\in\{\varnothing,\{\pt\}\}$ such that $\Gr_{\tbfe}(\tilde P_2^{[k]})=\{\pt\}$ if and only if $\tbfe\subset \mathcal Q_2^{[k]}$ is strong successor closed.

  Thus assume that the claim is true for $\tilde P_m$  and $\tilde P_{m+1}^{[k]}$ and consider the short exact sequence
  \[
    \ses{\tilde P_m}{\tilde P_{m+1}^{[k-1]}}{\tilde P_{m+1}^{[k]}}.
  \]
  We have $(\mathcal Q_{m+1}^{[k-1]})_0=(\mathcal Q_{m+1}^{[k]})_0\coprod{}(\mathcal Q_{m,k})_0$.
	Let $\beta_1\coprod\beta_2\subset (\mathcal Q_{m+1}^{[k-1]})_0\coprod{}(\mathcal Q_{m,k})_0$ be a pair of strong successor closed subsets which gives rise to a pair of non-empty cells by induction hypothesis.
 % Denote by $d(\beta_1+\beta_2)$ the dimension vector corresponding to this subset.
  By Proposition~\ref{quotient}, the fibre over the pair of cells corresponding to $\beta_1\coprod\beta_2$ is empty if and only if $\beta_2=(\mathcal Q_{m+1}^{[k]})_0$ and $\beta_1\cap(\mathcal Q_{m-1}^{[k]})_0=\varnothing$ where $\mathcal Q_{m-1}^{[k]}$ is considered as a $2$-quiver of $\mathcal Q_{m,k}$.
  But this is precisely the condition on $\beta_1\coprod\beta_2$ to be strong successor closed as $\mathcal Q_{m+1}^{[k]}$ is connected to $\mathcal Q_{m-1}^{[k]}$ by a $2$-arrow.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Compatible Pairs}
For $m\ge1$, let $D_m$ denote the maximal Dyck path in the lattice rectangle with corner vertices $(0,0)$ and $(u_m,u_{m-1})$.  
More precisely, $D_m$ is the lattice path which begins at $(0,0)$, takes East and North steps to end at $(u_m,u_{m-1})$, and never passes above the main diagonal joining $(0,0)$ and $(u_m,u_{m-1})$.  
It is maximal in the sense that any lattice point lying strictly above $D_m$ also lies above the main diagonal.  

The maximal Dyck paths $D_m$, $m\ge1$, exhibit the following recursive structure.
In what follows we assume $n\ge2$.
\begin{theorem}
  \cite[Corollary 2.4]{rupel}
  \label{th:dyck path recursion}
  For $n\ge2$, the maximal Dyck path $D_m$, $m\ge1$, can be constructed recursively as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $D_1$ consists of a single horizontal edge;
    \item $D_2$ consists of $n$ consecutive horizontal edges followed by a vertical edge;
    \item $D_m$, $m\ge3$, consists of $n-1$ copies of $D_{m-1}$ followed by a copy of $D_{m-1}$ with its first $D_{m-2}$ removed.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

We obtain the following as an immediate consequence.
\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:short hooks}
  Inside $D_m$, $m\ge2$, there are precisely $u_{m-2}$ vertical edges which are immediately preceded by exactly $n-1$ horizontal edges.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  We work by induction on $m\ge2$.
  The cases $m=2,3$ are immediate from Theorem~\ref{th:dyck path recursion} parts (2) and (3).
  For $m\ge4$, part (3) of Theorem~\ref{th:dyck path recursion} shows by induction that there are $(n-1)u_{m-3}+(u_{m-3}-u_{m-4})=u_{m-2}$ vertical edges which are immediately preceded by exactly $n-1$ horizontal edges.
\end{proof}

For $m\ge2$ and $1\le k\le n-1$, write $D_m^{(k)}$ for the maximal Dyck path obtained from $D_m$ by removing the first $k$ copies of $D_{m-1}$.
Extending this notation we also set $D_m^{(0)}:=D_m$.
\begin{remark}
  Note that by Theorem~\ref{th:dyck path recursion}, we have a natural identification of $D_m^{(n-1)}$, $m\ge3$, with $D_{m-1}^{(1)}$.
\end{remark}
For fixed $m\ge2$ and $1\le r\le n-1$, we write $D_{m-1,r}$ for the $r$-th copy of $D_{m-1}$ inside $D_m$.
For notational convenience we also set $D_{m-1,n}:=D_m^{(n-1)}$ even though this maximal Dyck path does not identify with a copy of $D_{m-1}$.
For $m\ge2$ and $1\le k\le n-1$, the maximal Dyck paths $D_{m-1,r}$, $k+1\le r\le n$, naturally identify with subpaths of $D_m^{(k)}$.

We identify the edges of $D_m$ with the ordered set $E_m=\{1,\ldots,u_m+u_{m-1}\}$, where edges of $D_m$ are taken in the natural order beginning from $(0,0)$.
Let $E_m=H_m\sqcup V_m$, where $H_m=\{h_1,\ldots,h_{u_m}\}$ and $V_m=\{v_1,\ldots,v_{u_{m-1}}\}$ denote the horizontal and vertical edges of $D_m$ respectively.
Following Theorem~\ref{th:dyck path recursion}, we partition the edges as $E_m=\bigsqcup_{r=1}^n E_{m-1,r}$, where $E_{m-1,r}$ denotes the edges of $D_{m-1,r}$.
The set $E_{m-1,r}$ is naturally partitioned into its subsets $H_{m-1,r}$ and $V_{m-1,r}$ of horizontal and vertical edges.

Given edges $e,e'\in E_m$ with $e<e'$, write $ee'$ for the shortest subpath of $D_m$ containing $e$ and $e'$, in particular $ee$ is the subpath containing the single edge $e$.
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:compatibility}
  A pair of subsets $S_H\subset H_m$ and $S_V\subset V_m$ is called \emph{compatible} if: 
  for each pair $(h,v)\in S_H\times S_V$ with $h<v$ there exists an edge $e\in hv$ so that at least one of the following holds
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:hgc}
    e\ne v\qquad\text{and}\qquad |he\cap V_m|=n|he\cap S_H|
  \end{equation}
  or
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:vgc}
    e\ne h\qquad\text{and}\qquad |ev\cap H_m|=n|ev\cap S_V|.
  \end{equation}
  Write $\cC_m$ for the collection of all pairs $(S_H,S_V)$ which are compatible as above.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  This notion of compatibility extends naturally to the maximal Dyck paths $D_m^{(k)}$, $1\le k\le n-1$.  Write $\cC_m^{(k)}$ for the set of all compatible pairs in $D_m^{(k)}$.
\end{remark}

The recursive structure of the maximal Dyck paths from Theorem~\ref{th:dyck path recursion} gives rise to a recursive characterization of compatible pairs.
\begin{definition}
  \cite[Definition 3.11]{rupel}
  \label{def:piecewise compatibility}
  A pair of subsets $S_H\subset H_m$ and $S_V\subset V_m$ is called \emph{piecewise compatible} if, for each $1\le r\le n$, one of the conditions \eqref{eq:hgc} or \eqref{eq:vgc} is satisfied for each pair $(h,v)\in S_H\times S_V$ with $h\in H_{m-1,r}$ and $v\in V_{m-1,r}$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  The notion of piecewise compatibility naturally extends to the maximal Dyck paths $D_m^{(k)}$, $1\le k\le n-1$.
\end{remark}

To describe precisely when a piecewise compatible pair $(S_H,S_V)$ is compatible we need more notation.
For a horizontal edge $h\in H_m$ and a subset $S_H\subset H_m$, write $D(h;S_H)=he$ for the shortest subpath of $D_m$ for which $|he\cap V_m|=n|he\cap S_H|$, if no such subpath exists we set $D(h;S_H)=hv_{u_{m-1}}$.
The subpath $D(h;S_H)$ is called the \emph{local shadow path} of $h$ with respect to $S_H$.
Similarly, for a vertical edge $v\in V_m$ and a subset $S_V\subset V_m$, the \emph{local shadow path} of $v$ with repect to $S_V$ is $D(v;S_V)=ev$ for the shortest subpath of $D_m$ for which $|ev\cap H_m|=n|ev\cap S_V|$ and we take $D(v;S_V)=h_1v$ if there does not exist such an edge $e$.
\begin{definition}
  \cite[Definition 3.17]{rupel}
  A horizontal edge $h_i\in H_m$, $m\ge3$, is called \emph{blocking} for a subset $S_H\subset H_m$ if $D(h_i;S_H)=h_iv_{u_{m-1}}$ and $h_i$ is furthest to the right with this property, i.e.\ the index $i$ is maximal with this property. 

  Suppose $S_H\subset H_m$ admits a blocking edge $h_i\in H_m$.
  Then $S_H$ is \emph{left-justified at $h_i$} if there exists $k\ge i$ so that $S_H=\{h_i,h_{i+1},\ldots,h_k\}$.
  The subset $S_H$ is \emph{strongly left-justified at $h_i$} if $S_H$ is left-justified at $h_i$ and $|h_iv_{u_{m-1}}\cap V_m|=n|h_iv_{u_{m-1}}\cap S_H|$.

  A subset $S_V\subset V_m$ is \emph{right-justified with respect to $h_i$} if there exists a vertical edge $v_s\in h_iv_{u_{m-1}}$ so that $S_V\cap h_iv_{u_{m-1}}=\{v_s,v_{s-1},\ldots,v_{u_{m-1}}\}$.
  The subset $S_V$ is \emph{strongly right-justified with respect to $h_i$} if $S_V$ is right-justified with respect to $h_i$ and $D(v_{u_{m-1}};S_V)=h_iv_{u_{m-1}}$ with $|h_iv_{u_{m-1}}\cap H_m|=n|h_iv_{u_{m-1}}\cap S_V|$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  \cite[Theorem 3.20 and Corollary 3.22]{rupel}
  \label{th:blocking edge conditions}
  For $m\ge3$, suppose $S_H\subset H_m$ and $S_V\subset V_m$ are piecewise compatible. 
  Then the following hold:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $S_H$ does not admit a blocking edge, then $(S_H,S_V)\in\cC_m$.
    \item Suppose $S_H$ admits a blocking edge $h_i\in H_m$ and $(S_H,S_V)$ is not compatible.
      Then $S_H$ is left-justified at $h_i$ and $S_V$ is strongly right-justified with respect to $h_i$.
      In addition the following hold:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $m=3$, then $S_H\cap h_iv_{u_{m-1}}=\{h_i\}$.
        \item If $m\ge4$, then $S_H$ is strongly left-justified at $h_i$.
        \item If $m\ge5$, then either $i=1$ or $h_i$ is immediately preceded by a vertical edge in $D_m$.
      \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
  For $m\ge4$ and $0\le k\le n-1$, consider $S_H\subset H_m^{(k)}$ and $S_V\subset V_m^{(k)}$ so that $(S_H,S_V)$ is piecewise compatible.
  Assume $\big(S_H^{(k+1)},S_V^{(k+1)}\big)\in\cC_m^{(k+1)}$.
  Then $(S_H,S_V)$ is not compatible if and only if $H_{m-2}^{(k+1)}\subset S_{H,k+1}$ and $V_m^{(k+1)}\subset S_V$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  We begin with the reverse implication.
  First note that there are $(n-k)u_{m-1}-u_{m-2}$ horizontal edges and $(n-k)u_{m-2}-u_{m-3}$ vertical edges in $D_m^{(k)}$. 
  It follows that $V_{m-2}^{(k+1)}\sqcup V_m^{(k+1)}$ contains $n(n-k)u_{m-3}-nu_{m-4}$ vertical edges and $H_{m-2}^{(k+1)}\sqcup H_m^{(k+1)}$ contains $n(n-k)u_{m-2}-nu_{m-3}$ horizontal edges.

  Assuming $H_{m-2}^{(k+1)}\subset S_{H,k+1}$ and $S_V^{(k+1)}=V_m^{(k+1)}$, we have $S_V\cap V_{m-2}^{(k+1)}=\varnothing$ and $S_H\cap H_m^{(k+1)}=\varnothing$ by piecewise compatibility.
  Let $h\in H_m^{(k)}$ be the horizontal edge corresponding to the first horizontal edge of $H_{m-2}^{(k+1)}$.
  Then, since there are $(n-k)u_{m-3}-u_{m-4}$ horizontal edges in $H_{m-2}^{(k+1)}$, the local shadow path $D(h;S_H)$ contains $n\big((n-k)u_{m-3}-u_{m-4}\big)$ vertical edges and is thus equal to $hv_{u_{m-1}}$.
  Similarly, the local shadow path $D(v_{u_{m-1}};S_V)$ is also equal to $hv_{u_{m-1}}$.
  In particular, neither of the compatibility conditions of Definition~\ref{def:compatibility} are satisfied for the path $hv_{u_{m-1}}$ and so $(S_H,S_V)$ is not compatible.

  For the forward implication, we work by induction on $m\ge4$.
  Consider a pair $(S_H,S_V)$ for $D_4^{(k)}$ as above which is not compatible.
  Following Theorem~\ref{th:blocking edge conditions}, write $h\in H_4^{(k)}$ for the blocking edge of $S_H$.
  Then the number of vertical edges in the local shadow path $D(h;S_H)=hv_{u_3}$ must be divisible by $n$. 
  Since $(S_H^{(k+1)},S_V^{(k+1)})$ is compatible, we must have $h\in H_{3,k}$.
  But observe that $|V_m^{(k)}|=(n-k)n-1$ and so the divisibility condition above implies $h\in H_{3,k}^{(n-1)}$.
  But $S_V$ is strongly right-justified with respect to $h$ and thus the number of horizontal edges in $D(v_{u_3};S_V)=hv_{u_3}$ is divisible by $n$.
  Identifying $H_{3,k}^{(n-1)}$ with $H_2^{(1)}$, this divisibility condition only occurs when $h$ is the first horizontal edge in $H_2^{(k+1)}\subset H_2^{(1)}$.
  Then by piecewise compatibility, the vertical edge of $H_2^{(1)}$ cannot be an element of $S_V$ and we must have $V_4^{(k+1)}\subset S_V$.
  By piecewise compatibility again, this implies $H_4^{(k+1)}\cap S_H=\varnothing$ and so $D(h;S_H)=hv_{u_3}$ implies $H_2^{(k+1)}\subset S_H$.

  To continue, let $(S_H,S_V)$ be a pair for $D_m$, $m\ge5$, which is not compatible.
  Write $\varphi:H_{m-1}\to V_m$ for the bijection given by $\varphi(h_i)=v_i$ for $1\le i\le u_{m-1}$.
  For any subset $T\subset H_{m-1}$, set $\varphi^*(T)=V_m\setminus\varphi(T)$.
  Clearly, the map $\varphi^*$ gives a bijection between subsets of $H_{m-1}$ and subsets of $V_m$.
  In Section 3.2 of \cite{rupel}, a new pair of subsets $\big((\varphi^*)^{-1}S_V,\Omega^{-1}S_H\big)$ for $D_{m-1}$ is given, we refer the reder to \emph{loc. cit} for notation.
  By \cite[Proposition 3.10]{rupel}, the pair $\big((\varphi^*)^{-1}S_V,\Omega^{-1}S_H\big)$ is not compatible, but is piecewise compatible by \cite[proposition 3.16]{rupel}.
  Thus by induction, we must have $H_{m-3}^{(k+1)}\subset(\varphi^*)^{-1}S_V$ and $V_{m-1}^{(k+1)}\subset\Omega^{-1}S_H$.
  It follows from piecewise compatibility that $H_{m-1}^{(k+1)}\cap(\varphi^*)^{-1}S_V=\varnothing$.
  But then by the definition of $\varphi^*$ we have $V_{m-2}^{(k+1)}\cap S_V=\varnothing$ and $S_V^{(k+1)}=V_m^{(k+1)}$ so that $D(v_{u_{m-1}};S_V)=hv_{u_{m-1}}$ with $h$ as in the first case above.
  Since $(S_H,S_V)$ is not compatible, Theorem~\ref{th:blocking edge conditions} states that $h$ must be the blocking edge for $S_H$ and we must have $D(h;S_H)=hv_{u_{m-1}}$.
  But this can only occur if $H_{m-2}^{(k+1)}\subset S_H$ since $H_m^{(k+1)}\cap S_H=\varnothing$ by piecewise compatibility.
\end{proof}


The following result is an immediate consequence of the combinatorial construction of rank 2 cluster variables \cite{llz} and the categorification of these variables using representations of $K(n)$ \cite{cc,ck}.
\begin{theorem}\cite{llz}
  For each $m\ge1$ and $\bfe\in\ZZ_{\ge0}^2$, we have $\chi\big(\Gr_\bfe(P_m)\big)=\big|\{(S_H,S_V)\in\cC_m:|S_H|=u_m-e_1,|S_V|=e_2\}\big|$.
\end{theorem}

Our goal is to show that the compatible pairs provide a natural labeling for the cells of $\chi\big(\Gr^Q_\bfe(P_m)\big)$ found in Theorem~ ?%\ref{???}.
